<p>You have been kind enough to receive favorably two volumes of
unpretentious impressions of your great and most hospitable country,
published in 1889 and 1891.</p>

<p>You are a dear friend and a delightful fellow. You are on the road that
will safely lead you to the discovery of everything that can insure the
prosperity of the land of which you are so justly proud.</p>

<p>Yet the Old World can teach you something; not how to work, but how to
live.</p>

<p>I have drawn a few sketches for you. Perhaps they will show you that
people can be happy without rolling in wealth, or living in a furnace.</p>

<p>Take up this little book and, lighting a cigar, lie down quietly on the
grass and read it under the shade of a tree.</p>

FRENCH CROCODILES.</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>FOREIGNERS.</h3>


<p>People very often speak ill of their neighbors,
not out of wickedness, but merely out of laziness;
it is so much easier to do so than to
study their qualities and all the circumstances
that might oblige you to change your opinion.</p>

<p>For instance, some fifty years ago, a great
English wit, Sydney Smith, said that it required
a surgical operation to make a Scotchman
understand a joke.</p>

<p>Well, an English joke, he probably meant.</p>

<p>However, the satire was neatly expressed.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 2]</span>
When the English get hold of a good joke,
and see it, it lasts them a long time.</p>

<p>The Scotch are a hundred times more witty
and humorous than the English; but John
Bull still goes on affirming that "it requires a
surgical operation to make a Scotchman understand
a joke."</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>If such misunderstanding can exist between
the English and the Scotch, just imagine what
feelings the natives of a land can inspire in
foreigners.</p>

<p>Oh! that word <i>foreigner</i>!</p>

<p>In some ears it sounds like bastards. In
some people's minds, it is the synonym of bad.
The English greengrocer, for instance, divides
his asparagus into large and small heads. The
fine large ones he binds together and sells at
high prices under the name of English asparagus.
The bundles of threads at one shilling
figure in his shop window as <i>foreign</i>.</p>

<p>In England, the adjective <i>English</i> is syn<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3]</span>onymous
with <i>excellent</i>. In France, we have
an adjective that signifies <i>excellent</i>, too, and
that is the adjective <i>French</i>. Do but make an
observation to a French shopkeeper upon the
price of his goods, and he will promptly answer:
"I keep a cheaper article, but it is
naturally of greatly inferior quality. Would
<i>Monsieur</i> like to see my English stock?" In
French commerce, <i>English</i> is synonymous
with <i>worthless</i>.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Now, what is a foreigner?</p>

<p>No man was born a foreigner.</p>

<p>Once an American said to me, on board a
steamer, sailing from Liverpool to New York:
"You are a foreigner, I guess."</p>

<p>"Well," I replied, "not yet. I shall be,
when I get to your country."</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>What is a foreigner?</p>

<p>As a rule, a foreigner is a good fellow,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 4]</span>
brought up by worthy parents, and belonging
to a country quite as good as yours.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Nations may be well or badly governed.
They may possess hot or cold climates, indifferent
or beautiful scenery. The manners and
customs of their inhabitants may be utterly
different. But the most stupid statement that
can possibly be made is that some nations are
better or worse than others.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>We French people ought not to be a closed
letter to the foreigner, for Heaven knows we
make no attempt to hide our defects, and I
might even add that if we did study to hide
them, instead of boasting of them, we might
cut quite as good and moral a figure as the
most proper inhabitant of the British Isles or
of the State of Maine.</p>

<p>We offer ourselves to criticism so unreserv<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 5]</span>edly,
owning our shortcomings with such
frankness, such <i>abandon</i>, that it ill becomes
our neighbors to find fault with us. Indeed,
we are a nation that confesses with a gay
candor that should disarm unkind criticism.</p>

<p>Yes, the foreigner ought to be able to read,
as in an open book, that good, warm-hearted,
France that he hardly looks at. For him,
France is Paris; Paris that supplies him with
pleasures for a fortnight, and that he despises
when he is satiated. The real France, peaceful
and laborious, he knows nothing about beyond
what he has seen of it from the windows
of a railroad car.</p>

<p>On arriving at home again, he writes to his
friends:</p>

<p>"I have just returned from France. What a
country it is! Ah! I have seen pretty sights,
I can assure you! I will tell you all about it
in private, when we meet. All I can say now
is, that I thank God that I was born an Englishman."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>Here is a good fellow who has undoubtedly
visited the wrong places.</p>

<p>The Frenchman is no better. He comes to
London for a week on business. (I say "on
business," because nobody would think of
coming to London on pleasure), and profits by
his visit to go and see Madame Tussaud's Exhibition.
Then he returns home, and exclaims,
parodying Victor Hugo's celebrated
lines: "How proud a man is to call himself a
Frenchman when he has looked at England."</p>

<p>He has looked at England, it is true, but he
has not seen it.</p>

<p>To <i>look</i> is an action of the body. To <i>see</i> is
an action of the mind.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>When people travel in foreign lands, they
often make two kinds of mistakes.</p>

<p>Firstly, they are liable to visit the wrong
places, like the Englishman who returned
home "thanking God he was born an Englishman."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Secondly, they draw conclusions too
quickly.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate this.</p>

<p>When English people alight at a French
hotel and find no soap on the washstand, do
you believe they conclude from this that the
French carry their own soap in their trunks
when they travel? Not they. They conclude
that the French do not wash, or that, if they
do, their ablutions are performed by means of
a corner of a handkerchief dipped in water.</p>

<p>Mark Twain, the prince of American humorists,
exclaims upon entering the bedroom of a
French hotel: "What, waiter, no soap! Don't
you know that soap is indispensable to an
Englishman or an American; and that only a
Frenchman can do without it?"</p>

<p>It is true that you find soap on the washstands
in English or American hotels; but the
English and their American cousins may perhaps
be astonished to hear that a true-born
Frenchman would have as much repugnance
to using hotel soap, as they would to using a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 8]</span>
toothbrush that they might find on a lodging-house
washstand. Some people like second-hand
soap; some do not. We will even make
bold to inform them that a great many French
ladies are so particular as to carry about a
supply of bedroom towels with them when
they travel.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>JOHN BULL UP TO DATE.</h3>


<p>Would you know what an Englishman is&mdash;let
him be a duke's son, officer in Her Majesty's
service, student, schoolboy, clerk, shopboy,
gentleman, or street rough?</p>

<p>Well, an Englishman is a lusty fellow, fearless,
hardy, and strong-knit, iron-muscled, and
mule-headed, who, rather than let go a ball
that he holds firmly in his arms, will perform
feats of valor; who, to pass this ball between
two goals, will grovel in the dust, reckless of
lacerated shoulders, a broken rib or jawbone,
and will die on a bed of suffering with a smile
upon his lips if he can only hear, before closing
his eyes, that his side has won the game.</p>

<p>Multiply this Englishman by the number of
the stars in the firmament, and you will arrive<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]</span>
at a pretty correct idea of England's martial, if
not military, force.</p>

<p>The Englishman does nothing by halves.
His favorite adjective is <i>thorough</i>. The more
difficulties he has to surmount the more he is
in his element; he is a curious mixture of lion,
mule, and octopus. Outdoing Milo of Crotona,
he would manage to withdraw his wrist
from the cleft of the oak.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone said one day (many years
ago): "When I work, I work as hard as I can;
when I run, I run as fast as I can; when I
jump, I jump as far as I can." He might add
now: "When I get into a mess, I plunge into
it over head and shoulders."</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>To three qualities I ascribe the success of
John Bull: his tenacity, the coolness of his
head, and the thickness of his skin.</p>

<p>Take an Englishman to visit the ruins of
some old castle: he will not rest until he has
thrust his nose into every nook and cranny of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]</span>
the place, and climbed the most crumbling
walls, at the risk of breaking his neck over and
over again. He has seen nothing if he has not
seen all. You may think yourself lucky if he
has not profited by your back being turned for
a moment, to go and hoist the Union Jack on
the summit of the highest tower. That is a
little weakness of his that makes him a trifle
inconvenient occasionally, I must say; but,
you see, one cannot get on in this world without
a certain aptitude for making one's self at
home.</p>

<p>He conquers the world for the good of the
world. When he goes after pastures new, he
takes the Bible with him. It will not be long
before the natives have the Bible, and he their
land. On arriving upon his new field of operation,
the missionary places the Bible in the
hands of the natives, and thus addresses them:
"My dear Brethren, lift your eyes to Heaven,
and pray. Lift your eyes&mdash;higher&mdash;higher&mdash;still
higher&mdash;that's it. Now close them, and
do not open them until I tell you&mdash;that's it<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]</span>&mdash;pray&mdash;there&mdash;now
open your eyes, you are
saved."</p>

<p>When the worthy natives open their eyes,
their territory is gone.</p>

<p>Truly, a strange being, but an interesting
subject of study, is this same Englishman.
Capable of combining a thousand different
personages, of playing a thousand different
parts, of doing in Rome (to use his own words)
as the Romans do; extreme in each of his
acts, presenting the most striking contrasts,
but always guided by his reason. Fiery patriot,
yet calmly bearing the greatest humiliations
while awaiting the propitious moment for
taking his innings. In the temple, a publican,
crying aloud, "O Lord, I am but a miserable
sinner!" Outside its door, a Pharisee, setting
up for a marvel of virtue. Worshiper of Mammon
and Jehovah, the man most concerned in
the interests of the next world, and most
wrapped up in the concerns of this.</p>

<p>In the singular, a man upon whose word you
can rely as you would upon a trusty sword;<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]</span>
in the plural, a people who have too often
merited the epithet "perfidious." At home,
preaching temperance, even to the forswearing
of all drinks but water; abroad, not only encouraging,
but enforcing the opium trade. At
home, prosecuting the individual that ill-uses
an animal, unless, indeed, the animal be a wife;
abroad, setting a price upon the head of a
recalcitrant foe. At home, punishing with
imprisonment the people who obstruct the
rowdy processions of the Salvation Army
mountebanks; in India, sending to prison the
same mountebanks, who, in their zeal, might
create religious difficulties among a nation
that he has subdued.</p>

<p>Opportunist <i>par excellence</i>, he never asks all
or nothing. He accepts a little as being better
than nothing; and thus it is that little by
little, without shock or violence, without revolutions,
he perfects the machinery of his constitution.</p>

<p>Everything John Bull does is perfect.
When anything goes wrong, he knows where<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 14]</span>
to lay the blame: he keeps Scotchmen, Irishmen,
and Welshmen conveniently at hand for
that purpose.</p>

<p>At prayer time, a man appearing somewhat
uncomfortable. When he prays, he makes a
grimace, or hides his face in his hat, and reminds
one of Heinrich Heine's sayings, "that a
blaspheming Frenchman must be a more pleasing
object in the sight of God than a praying
Englishman."</p>

<p>Also watch John Bull as the collection is
going on. Hear him sing at the top of his
voice</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
Were the whole realm of nature mine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That were an offering far too small</span><br />
Love so amazing, so divine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Demands my life, my soul, my all.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>And all the time see how carefully he feels
his pockets to be quite sure that it is a three-penny
bit that he has got hold of.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>And what a diplomatist he is! Ask him for
a reform, and he will stare at you astonished,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 15]</span>
assuring you that all is for the best in the best
of worlds. But shake your fist at him, and
show him that you mean to have that reform,
and he will smile, and say: "Oh, that's all
right, I beg your pardon, I didn't know that
you were in earnest."</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>To sum up:</p>

<p>Worshiping his old monarchy, devoted to
his old institutions, but ravenous for justice
and liberty, he would be ready again to-day to
demolish both monarchy and constitution, as
he did in the seventeenth century, if his liberty
ran the least danger. In politics, possessing
the virtues that are indispensable to the
prosperity of a nation&mdash;respect of the law and
respect of power clearly manifested&mdash;he always
bows to the decision of a majority. Refusing
to submit to despotism in any shape or form,
he himself keeps in order and discipline all his
paid guides and governors: his queen, his
princes, his ministers, his generals, his judges,
his priests.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Wise, industrious, and persevering, never
doubting his strength, above all minding his
own business, and imposing upon one and all
their attributions and duties, from his sovereign
down to the humblest citizen, he has
chosen for his motto:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
Fais bien ce que fais.<br />

<h3>JACQUES BONHOMME, THE LANDED PEASANT-PROPRIETOR
OF FRANCE.</h3>


<p>Jacques Bonhomme is a small landowner,
fond of his country, his cottage, his fields, his
cow, and his <i>gros sous</i>. His great aim is to be
independent of the world, and to this end he
takes great care of his pence, and has no need
of any French John Bright to tell him that if
he does so, the pounds will take care of themselves;
it is a sentiment inborn in him. If
you wish to make him happy, when he brings
you a load of wood or a cask of cider, pay him
in silver five-franc pieces&mdash;his coin of predilection.
He will take gold without repugnance,
but will look askance at a banknote. If you
were to tender him a check, the odds are ten
to one that he would immediately go for a
policeman.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>He does not seek to imitate the dweller in
cities, either in his habits, speech, or dress.
All he has on his back is not worth more than
four or five francs, but his blouse is new when
he buys it, and it belongs to him, as my black
coat belongs to me. His food costs him about
fourpence or fivepence a day at the outside,
but it is wholesome and abundant. He keeps
early hours and saves his candles, he lives a
healthy life and saves doctors' bills. When he
lies down to die, it is in his own bed, and his
parish has not to pay for his funeral.</p>

<p>Every French village has its poor, but pauperism
is unknown, for Jacques Bonhomme is
charitable, and he always finds means to send
a basin of soup to a neighbor whom he knows
to be in want of one. It is only for the loafer
that he has no pity; when he has called a fellow-creature
<i>fain&eacute;ant</i>, he has used the strongest
invective in his vocabulary.</p>

<p>In politics, he takes very little interest, if
any. All governments are acceptable to him,
except perhaps the one that happens to be in
power when he gets bad weather for the har<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 19]</span>vest.
How else explain the fact that changes
of government have always been made in Paris
without his sanction, or even his opinion being
asked for; and that the seven million five hundred
thousand men who vote for the Republic
to-day, are the seven million five hundred
thousand who, when they were asked by the
Emperor, in the year of the Plebiscite, whether
they would still have him or not, answered
almost to a man: "I will."</p>

<p>Jacques Bonhomme scarcely knew what a
Plebiscite was; but he went to see his parish
priest, who said to him:</p>

<p>"Are you married, Jacques?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>monsieur le cur&eacute;</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, and what did they make you say on
your wedding day?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi, monsieur le cur&eacute;</i>, they made me
say, <i>I will</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, my good fellow, that is all the Emperor
asks you to say; that is voting."</p>

<p>Whereupon Jacques went and threw his <i>oui</i>
in the electoral box.</p>

<p>There is one form of government, however,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 20]</span>
of which he would dread the return: the government
of the <i>cur&eacute;s</i>. He has not forgotten
the tithe and the <i>corv&eacute;e</i>, nor the days when the
monks used to come and pay little visits to his
wife and his cupboard, to bless his children,
and relieve him of his superfluous butter and
eggs.</p>

<p>He is no great churchgoer; yet, when he
meets his parish priest, he touches his cap, but
almost as he would touch it to an equal.</p>

<p>He is beginning to know how to hold a pen,
but he rarely uses one except for the purpose
of adding up his little accounts. As to letter-writing,
he sees no fun in a frivolous pastime
that would cost him three <i>sous</i>.</p>

<p>He has been placed by Nature on a fertile
soil that yields him all he needs, and if you
were to talk to him of emigration, he would
stare and ask you what crime he had committed
to deserve transportation. There is no
more home-abiding creature upon the face of
the earth.</p>

<p>You may tell him you are going round the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]</span>
world. He will let you go. He is not jealous.</p>

<p>On the wall of the village schoolroom he has
seen a map of the world, but although he is
willing to believe that it fairly represents the
earth we live on, he would fain have seen the
name of his dear village on it. He doubts not
that the earth is round, since his <i>cur&eacute;</i> and his
schoolmaster say so; but the only proof he has
of it is the sight of the line of horizon that
greets his eyes, when he climbs the hill-top.</p>

<p>I know two or three of these honest French
workers, who were induced to go to Paris in
1878, to see the Universal Exhibition. Such
was their suspicion of the gay capital that,
before setting out, they sewed their golden
louis in the lining of their coats, and had their
wills made by the notary.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The French peasant is peaceful, sober, and
laborious. He possesses in a remarkable degree
that invaluable quality than which there<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 22]</span>
is no higher intelligence for the solution of the
great problem of existence, which consists in
patiently accepting one's fate, however hard
it may be, and making the best of it. His
ideal of life is the independence which is the
fruit of labor, and he is satisfied with very little
in the days of his strength, because the prospect
of eating his own bread when his strength
is gone makes him happy. He is thrifty and
self-denying, but he is not deficient in any of
the generous sentiments. He befriends his
poorer relatives, he can be hospitable and charitable,
and a patriot, too, when occasion calls,
as history has proved. But he is no fire-eater,
no yearner after social regeneration by baptism
of blood, no dreamer of new worlds to conquer,
nor the revival of dying feuds in ghastly
wars. The surging passions of the capital,
bred and fed by vice and improvidence, are
horrible to him. He wishes the world to be
at peace, so that he may be left alone, and be
allowed to raise his flocks and grow his corn
and wine in peace.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>It is when he is making a purchase, at the
fair or at the market, that Jacques is to be
seen in his element.</p>

<p>Look at him as he takes a preliminary turn
or two around the little rickety stall. He hesitates
a long while before making up his mind;
he knows that if he seems to have a fancy for
any particular article, he will probably be
asked a good price for it. So it is only cautiously,
and with a look of indifference on his
face, that he at length draws near. Next, taking
up the coveted object with the limpest of
fingers, he gives off sundry little grunts of disapprobation.
He turns it over and over, looks
at it well on all sides, shakes his head, and
invariably finishes by dropping it back in its
place again.</p>

<p>Then he turns, and makes as though he
would go away, but after having taken a few
steps, he brings up, comes back, and indicating
the object of his maneuvers with a contemptuous
finger, says to the vender:</p>

<p>"What do you want for <i>that</i>?"<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>And you should see the face he makes as he
says "<i>that</i>."</p>

<p>He has scarcely heard the reply before he
exclaims: "You mean that for a joke, I suppose."</p>

<p>Watch him a little later, as he goes off, carrying
his purchase in triumph, and you will
plainly see that he has made a bargain.</p>

<p>If Solomon had known Jacques Bonhomme,
we might be inclined to think that it was he
whom the Hebrew king had in his mind's eye,
as he wrote: "It is naught, it is naught, saith
the buyer; but when he has gone his way,
then he boasteth."</p>

<p>Jacques' manner is no less remarkable when
he has to part with the value in cash.</p>

<p>He seldom carries his money in his trousers'
or waistcoat pocket. He confides it to the
depths of a long purse, from which it is only
to be extracted with difficulty, and this purse
is hidden inside his blouse, and carefully
attached to it by a strong leather string.</p>

<p>When the operation of paying has to be<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]</span>
performed, Jacques gently lifts his blouse, and,
making a rather wry face, draws forth his
purse from its hiding-place. In the act of untying
the leather string, he is as unhappy-looking
a creature as you may well behold.
He rarely faces the enemy on these occasions.
He turns his back to you, and pretends to have
great difficulty in getting his money out of his
recalcitrant purse. Perhaps he hopes you will
get tired of waiting, and say to him: "Never
mind, Jacques, you can pay me another day."</p>

<p>When at last he has the money in his hand,
he turns toward you, holds it out, draws it
back, but eventually makes up his mind to the
loss of this little portion of his patrimony.</p>

<p>Then he begins to wonder whether you have
not taken him in; but, as it is too late to draw
back, he resolves that he will be a match for
you next time.</p>

<h3>JACQUELINE, THE FORTUNE OF FRANCE.</h3>


<p>Jacques Bonhomme's wife is the fortune of
France. Hard-working, thrifty, sober, you will
always see her busy, either working in the
field, selling her wares in the market-place of
the nearest town, or engaged about her little
household. She is the personification of industry,
and when the winter of life comes on,
you will find her by the chimney corner, or
near the cottage door, keeping watch over the
little ones, while she knits or spins; it is with
her needles or her distaff in her hand that she
peacefully passes away from earth. Not an
hour in the life of the good Jacqueline has
been spent in indolence.</p>

<p>It is she who hides the five-franc pieces in
the corner of her linen cupboard, only to be
taken out when there is an opportunity of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 28]</span>
rounding off the little family domain. Shares,
bonds, and all such lottery tickets, she leaves
for the small <i>bourgeois</i> of the town, who love
to wait their turn at the door of the Treasury
Office on the day of a national loan. No
papers for her; what she likes is a field or a
cow, something she is quite sure to find in its
place in the morning, when she wakes up.</p>

<p>It is on market-day that you should see her!
She makes light of a ten or twelve-mile walk
to the chief town of her district, carrying a
basket loaded with fruit or vegetables on each
arm. In the evening, you may meet her with
baskets empty, but pockets full, trudging back
to her peaceful cottage&mdash;the center of all her
affections. Follow her along the road a little,
and you will see that, as she goes, she manages
to busy her fingers on a pair of stockings
for the little ones.</p>

<p>Her daughter does not wear fringes on her
forehead, feathers on her hat, fifty-cent diamonds
in her ears, or flounces on a second-hand
skirt; but, though she is dressed in a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 29]</span>
plain coarse serge gown, and a simple snowy
cap, her round rosy cheeks tell you that she is
healthy, and a pair of eyes, that stare at you
like the daisies in her father's field, tell you
that she is pure.</p>

<p>When she goes into service&mdash;which is often
the case&mdash;every month, as she receives her
wages, she quietly pays a little visit to the savings
bank of the town.</p>

<p>When the English servant receives her
monthly wages, she straightway goes to buy a
new hat and get photographed in it.</p>

<p>I will refrain from speaking of the duchesses
who condescend to act as "helps" to the
American public.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>And the patriotism of her! Ah, let me
here pay my humble tribute of admiration and
gratitude that she has so great a claim to!
Who among us French has not kept, engraven
on his memory, the <i>souvenir</i> of the
devoted peasant women of Normandy, Pi<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 30]</span>cardy,
of Alsace and Lorraine, and all they did
for us in that terrible year that would have
seen the death of France, if France could die?
Who among us has not admired and blessed
them? With a sad smile on her face, how
kindly the poor Jacqueline welcomed the
weary soldier, worn out with fatigue and hunger!
And, while the rich <i>bourgeois</i> too often
received us with a frown, as he muttered,
"More soldiers!" her greeting was always
kindly. "Come in, my poor lads," she would
cry; "you are tired and hungry. We have
not much to offer here, but you shall have a
bed to-night, if it is but a bed of straw, a good
soup, and a rasher of bacon, or whatever there
is in the cupboard. That will do you good.
My own poor lad is fighting somewhere; it is
many weeks ago now that I heard from him,
but I hope some kind soul is doing for him
to-night what I am doing for you." And the
good creature would prepare her vegetables,
put the soup on the fire, make up beds for us
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 31]</span>
around the hearth, and give us old soft shoes
for our poor blistered feet. And when, in the
morning, we left her hospitable roof, we would
say, "<i>Allons, maman, adieu et merci</i>. God
bless you for all you have done for us." And
as we went our way, she, standing on the
threshold of her door, would wave her handkerchief,
and watch the regiment out of sight.
Then she would turn away, and the evening
found her ready to do the same for the next
weary band of men that halted at her door.</p>


<p><br />Oh! my good peasant folk of France, you
are the fortune of your country, and you also,
with your rustic simplicity, are its generous
heart. It is among you that tired human
nature drinks deep draughts of pure life-giving
air, and forgets the struggles of the city, its
noisy pleasures, its ephemeral joys, its jealousies
and burning hatreds; it is in your midst
that the soul is tuned into harmony with mankind,
and man feels at peace with all the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 32]</span>
world, as he looks at the bright spring blossoms,
breathes the intoxicating perfume of the
humid forest, and gazes at Nature, as she
emerges from her bath of dew to robe herself
in a raiment of light.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>JOSEPH PRUDHOMME, THE JOG-TROT MIDDLE-CLASS
FRENCHMAN.</h3>


<p>Joseph Prudhomme, whom the Anglo-Saxon
people are fond of representing as a fighting
cock, sighing constantly after glory and conquest,
is a modest proprietor, peaceful, home-loving,
steady-going, whom his mother calls
"<i>petit</i>," and his wife leads by the nose.</p>

<p>Glory and conquests! he has had enough of
all that: it is peace that he asks for at the top
of his voice. Like his social inferior, Jacques
Bonhomme, the only conquest that he hankers
after, is the conquest of that independence
which is assured by a safe investment at three
or three and a half per cent.</p>

<p>Joseph is not wealthy, but he is rich, rich
like most of us, not in that which he possesses,
but in that which he knows how to do with<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 34]</span>out.
He is rich, because the little he has got
is always safe and stable.</p>

<p>It is stability in fortunes and the proper distribution
of wealth over a nation which constitute
real riches, and that is why France, who
has now more than six millions of contented
landed proprietors, is probably, in the proper
sense of the word, the richest nation in the
world.</p>

<p>Joseph is by no means a great speculator.
Economical and industrious, he quickly goes
on his sober way, until he has amassed the
snug little sum that will allow him to live at
his ease.</p>

<p>To have from one to two thousand dollars a
year, such is his aim. As soon as he has
attained it, he knocks off work and takes life
easily, devoting his time to his wife and family.</p>

<p>Economy is the very genius of France.
The peasant buys a bit of land; the working
classes put something in the savings bank,
which, at the present moment, has more than
$450,000,000 in its coffers. The middle classes<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 35]</span>
buy government securities. Very few people
speculate.</p>

<p>In France, everybody runs after comfort,
but few run after wealth. When an American
has a million, he must have two, and then ten.
He forgets that he can possess one million,
but cannot possess ten, without losing his
peace of mind and happiness. The Frenchman
wants comfort; he wants enough to
establish his children, educate his boys, portion
his daughters, and spend his old days in
quietness. He wants no more. In France,
we have no Jay Goulds. If a Suez Canal was
made, it did not owe its existence to a few
capitalists, but to hundreds and thousands of
workers who brought their savings.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>When Joseph has retired from business, he
begins to dream of honors. The words Town
Counselor, District Counselor, and Mayor, are
pleasing to his ear, inasmuch as these honorable
posts enable their holders to wear uni<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 36]</span>forms.
And Joseph has a decided weakness
for uniforms and gold braid. A sword specially;
a sword adds an inch or two to his
stature.</p>

<p>He is fond of making sounding phrases, and
his signature is a masterpiece of inimitable calligraphy.</p>

<p>His game of predilection is dominoes.
When he plays at loto, he never fails to add,
after announcing the number seven, <i>la pipe &agrave;
Thomas</i>.</p>

<p>When he sends twenty francs to his boy, he
scrupulously seals the envelope in five places,
and stares incredulously, if you tell him that
the English often stuff a bundle of banknotes
into their letters, and do not take the trouble
to register them.</p>

<p>He has the name of being a Republican. I
am willing to believe him one, since he now
votes for the Republic; but it is less from profound
conviction than from the dread of hearing
that barricades are being erected in Paris,
that he votes for the government of the day.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 37]</span>
"<i>Beati possidentes!</i>" he cries, there is nothing
like tranquillity.</p>

<p>He is administered to his heart's content.</p>

<p>He belongs to a little town, administered by
a mayor, two deputy-mayors, and a municipal
council; his little town forms part of an <i>arrondissement</i>,
administered by a sub-prefect and a
council of <i>arrondissement</i>; his <i>arrondissement</i>
forms part of a department, administered by a
prefect, a council of prefecture, and a general
council; his department forms part of France,
administered by a President of the Republic, a
ministerial council, a council of state, a Senate,
and a Chamber of Deputies. Add to this, the
general council of agriculture, the general
council of commerce, the council of manufactures,
the council of mines, the council of
roads and bridges, the council general of
prisons, the council of war, the council of
finance, the council of the navy, the council
of <i>prud'hommes</i>, the board of health, and a
hundred others, and you will see that, if Joseph<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 38]</span>
pays taxes, he has the satisfaction of knowing
that he is counseled abundantly.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>His accounts are kept by an administration
that "all Europe envies," and carried to the
fourth decimal, a luxury which costs him a
good fourth of his revenue in <i>personnel</i> and
red tape, but which on the other hand saves
the Treasury at least one dollar per annum.
The centimes column is guaranteed exact by
every French clerk; this ought to console
Joseph for the little errors which may exist in
the column of the millions. In a ministerial
office, a mistake of a centime puts the whole
staff in commotion, from the ground floor to
the roof, and if a clerk were to propose to
replace the centime out of his own pocket, and
thus set matters right, he would be looked
upon as a dangerous man, and his career would
be blasted, unless, indeed, the affair should
make some noise, in which case he might see<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 39]</span>
himself provided with a seat in the Chamber
of Deputies.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>In business, Joseph's probity is almost proverbial,
and his punctuality carried to a ridiculous
point. On quarter day, he pays his rent
at the stroke of noon. In England, the landlord
can only demand his rent twenty-one days
after it is due, and bills are only presented
after three days' grace. His commerce is hindered
by his exaggerated attention to trifles,
but when he sells you a pair of boots, you can
put them on, and walk in them.</p>

<p>He is jealous of his reputation, and a compliment
paid to the quality of his merchandise
gives him as much pleasure as the profit he
gets out of it.</p>

<p>I do not hesitate to affirm that not only
does the small French <i>bourgeois</i> not covet
wealth, but that he is almost afraid of it. I
might name many old provincial parents, who
have written long letters to their sons, com<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 40]</span>mencing
with congratulations upon the literary,
artistic, or other successes they had met
with in Paris, and ending with lamentations
over the financial ones which had resulted
therefrom. These good people were full of
fear lest money should raise a barrier between
them and their dear son, and thus cloud the
happiness of the family.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Joseph rarely renounces his bachelor's life
before the age of thirty.</p>

<p>When he marries, woman is not exactly an
enigma to him; but do you think he is any
the worse husband for that? Not he. The
purity of his wife becomes an object of worship
for him; he recognizes in her a moral being so
superior to himself that he soon abdicates all
his prerogatives in her favor; and he consoles
himself for the authority that he rarely knows
how to maintain in his home, with the thought
that the administration of his affairs is in safe
hands. Taking life placidly, he grows round<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 41]</span>
and rubicund; he is well cared for, petted,
coddled; he lives in clover. His wife is his
friend, his confidante. If from one cause or
another the family revenue diminishes, she
knows it as soon as her husband; with her
economy and good management, she faces the
danger; with her energy, she wards off ruin
from her threshold. In important matters, as
well as in the smallest, she has both a consultative
and deliberative voice. Content with her
supremacy in the home circle, she asks for no
other rights; politics are not in her line. And
yet a French woman is far from lacking patriotism.
Those same timid girls and tender
mothers who could not bear us out of their
sight, are the women who said to us, not long
since: "Do not think about us; your country
claims you, do your duty."</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Provincial life in France is narrow, limited
in the highest degree, I must admit; but what
wealth of love and happiness those little<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 42]</span>
coquettish-looking white houses hold! They
are so many nests!</p>

<p>The greatest charm about our provincials,
who are constantly made the butt for Parisian
witticisms, is that they do not change.</p>

<p>When you live that feverish Parisian life,
that consumes you by overtaxing your intellectual
powers, what a treat it is to go and see
the old folks, in the old house that is standing
there just as you remember it in your childhood!
Every room, every piece of furniture,
is linked in your memory with some event of
bygone days. How you revive in that old
place!</p>

<p>In the thickest darkness you could find
everything. Your dear old mother is there in
her chair by the window, in her favorite place,
which has not altered so much as an inch.
The old servant, who danced you on her knee,
watches at the door for the first glimpse of the
carriage that brings you. And the cries of
joy, and the clapping of hands! What welcome
awaits you! Everyone speaks at the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 43]</span>
same time, you are taken by storm, nobody
thinks of checking his delight (in France, joy
is allowed free outlet). You go up to the
room that used to be yours to shake off the
dust of your journey. Nothing is altered,
everything is there, just where it always was
in the old days; you feel as if you had grown
twenty years younger. You go down, and in
the dining room you see the large fireplace
that has undergone no stupid modernizing.
Will you ever forget the bloodcurdling ghost
stories that you listened to so breathlessly in
the twilight, as you roasted chestnuts in the
embers? What shivers of horror would run
through you as you nestled close up in that
chimney corner! And so all the past revives
again: the April walks in quest of dewy primroses,
the scamper over the daisy-strewn fields
in the glorious summer sunshine; the clandestine
raids on the pear trees, and the scoldings
from mother, who was sure to read the history
of the afternoon in the meek faces and torn
raiment.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>The Frenchman of the provinces wraps himself
up in his family, almost to the exclusion
of the outer world. In the streets he salutes
his acquaintances with a profound bow; on
New Year's Day he pays them a visit of ceremony,
offers the ladies a packet of <i>marrons
glac&eacute;s</i>, or a couple of oranges; but his hospitable
table is only open to his children, who, as
long as he lives, are at home in the house.
One or two intimate friends at most are
allowed to penetrate freely into the little
circle; the time is killed, even killed by inches,
A garden, chickens, ducks, the Saturday <i>pot-au-feu</i>,
such is the extent of his ambition. All
this luxury can be obtained for about a hundred
dollars a month. When his three per
cent. <i>rentes</i> secure him this sum, he retires
from business, and gives his younger fellow-creatures
a chance.</p>

<p>His family being generally small, he has all
his dear ones around him, under his roof.</p>

<p>He idolizes children, and makes the most
charming father in the world.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>To give a good education to his sons, and a
good <i>dot</i> to his daughters, to see them happily
married, and keep them near him after their
marriage, to bring up his grandchildren, guide
their first tottering steps, make companions of
them, launch them in life, and see them all
assembled around his death-bed, such is the
life of the good Joseph Prudhomme.</p>

<h3>ENTERTAINING NEIGHBORS.</h3>


<p>To an impartial observer, who goes on his way
philosophizing, and keeping his eyes open to
what passes on either side of the English
Channel, it is really a very amusing sight to
see how the two countries seem to make it
their aim, each to do the contrary of what the
other does.</p>

<p>Will you have a few rather diverting illustrations,
taken right and left?</p>

<p>When we are in difficulties, we take our
watch to our <i>aunt</i>; the English take theirs to
their <i>uncle</i>.</p>

<p>In France, the <i>cur&eacute;</i> has a certain number of
<i>vicaires</i> under his orders; in England, it is the
<i>curate</i> who is the <i>vicar's</i> subaltern. On this
point, there is no doubt about our being in the
right, since a curate is a priest, ordained to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 48]</span>
take charge of a <i>cure</i> (the responsible care of
souls), whereas a vicar (<i>vicarius</i>) is a priest
who takes the place of another.</p>

<p>So, you see, that is one to us!</p>

<p>In France, coachmen keep to the right; in
England, they keep to the left. The drivers
of hansom cabs are seated far from their
horses, and are obliged to use very long whips;
but, as they keep to the left, the action of the
whip takes place in the middle of the road, and
thus peaceful promenaders of the pavement
are spared many a disagreeable cut.</p>

<p>Well done, John, one to you this time!</p>

<p>The French language possesses the two
words <i>&eacute;diter</i> and <i>publier</i>; the English language
has to <i>edit</i> and to <i>publish</i>. But it must be well
understood that it is to <i>publish</i> which means
<i>&eacute;diter</i>, and to <i>edit</i> which means <i>publier</i>. These
Chinese puzzles, so constantly met with, are
not useless, however; they are the delight of
French examiners in England, and, of course,
the despair of candidates, which is easy to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 49]</span>
understand, if one considers how much easier
it is to be examiner than examined.</p>

<p>In England, you "get wet to the skin," in
France, we "get wet to the bones," and you
know that, when the English go as far as the
backbone, the French, not to be outdone, go
as far as the marrow of the bone.</p>

<p>In England, people are witty "to their fingers'
end"; in France, "to the end of their
finger-nails."</p>

<p>The index is placed at the beginning of
English books, but at the end of French ones.</p>

<p>Both the French and English languages have
aspirate <i>h</i>'s, but, whereas in English it is vulgar
to drop them, in French it is vulgar to sound
them.</p>

<p>In France, it is considered very bad form to
call people by their names directly after being
introduced to them. We simply address them
as Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle. In
England, only shopmen address ladies as
Madam, or Miss. When you have been intro<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 50]</span>duced,
you must add a person's surname to the
title, to Mr., Mrs., or Miss, in speaking to them.</p>

<p>In England, they "take French leave"; but in
France we "take English leave," and we are
quits.</p>

<p>The pound sterling contains twenty shillings,
the shilling twelve pence, the penny four
farthings; and if you want to find out, for
instance, how much the sum of 356 pounds, 18
shillings, and 9 pence 3 farthings, has brought
in, at compound interest, in four years, five
months, and eight days, at the rate of 3<small><sup>7</sup>/<sub>19</sub></small> per
cent., I would advise you to procure a ream of
foolscap paper and set to work. When you
have waded through the sum, you will wonder
how it is that the English, practical as they
are, have not adopted the decimal system.
But then, you see, they have adopted it in
France.</p>

<p>Even down to the manner of holding a fork
or an umbrella, the two nations seem to be
saying to each other: "You do it that way?
very well, then, I shall do it this way."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>In making an inventory of the contrasts in
the two nations, it would be difficult to say
which is oftener in the right. The balance is
probably pretty even.</p>

<p>The last I will mention is the difference in
the manner of keeping Good Friday, and in
this, I think, the good mark ought to be for us.</p>

<p>Good Friday, being the anniversary of the
death of our Savior, the French keep it in
fasting and prayer. On the following Sunday,
the day of His Resurrection, they rejoice.
Easter day, being Sunday, finds the English
people plunged in solemn silence; but, on
Good Friday, they take their holiday, and the
lower orders celebrate their Redeemer's death
by knocking down cocoanuts.</p>

<h3>FRENCH IMPULSIVENESS AND BRITISH
SANGFROID ILLUSTRATED BY TWO
REMINISCENCES.</h3>


<p>Two incidents that took place lately, in Paris
and London respectively, may serve to illustrate
French impulsiveness and English <i>sangfroid</i>.</p>

<p>The other evening the opera "Les Huguenots"
was played at the Grand Opera. The
singer who took the part of <i>Marcel</i> was out
of sorts, and sang flat. An old gentleman,
seated in an orchestra stall, was observed to
be restless and uncomfortable during the performance.
At the end of the last act, <i>Marcel</i>
passes before the church, just at the moment
when the <i>Duke of Nevers</i> and his partisans
come out of it.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>"<i>Qui vive?</i>" cries the <i>Duke</i>.</p>

<p>"Huguenot," answers <i>Marcel</i>, and he falls,
shot dead by the followers of the <i>Duke</i>.</p>

<p>This part of the opera had no sooner been
acted, than the old gentleman, who now
looked radiant, rose from his seat, put on his
hat, and, shaking his fist at the dead hero, to
the great amusement of the public, cried at
the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"You donkey, it serves you right, you have
been singing out of tune the whole evening."</p>

<p>And indignantly he left the theater.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>In a beautifully appointed English house,
afternoon tea, served in costly china, had just
been brought to the drawing-room, when the
mistress of the house inadvertently overturned
the tea-table. Without the slightest show of
vexation, without <i>oh!</i> or <i>ah!</i> Lady R&mdash;&mdash;
calmly touched the bell, and, on the appearance
of the domestic, merely said:<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>"Take this away, and bring more tea."</p>

<p>"My dear," whispered Lady P&mdash;&mdash; to a
friend, "she won't match that china for $500."</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Another illustration of the latter:</p>

<p>A fearful railway accident has taken place.
The first car, with its human contents, is reduced
to atoms.</p>

<p>An Englishman, who was in one of the first-class
cars at the rear, examines the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he says to an official, pointing to a
piece of flesh wrapped up in a piece of tweed
cloth. "Pick that up, that's the piece of my
butler that has got the keys of my trunks."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 57]</span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>ENGLISH PHARISEES AND FRENCH CROCODILES.</h3>


<p>The French and the English have this very
characteristic feature in common: they can
stand any amount of incense; you may burn
all the perfumes of Arabia under their noses,
without incommoding them in the slightest
degree.</p>

<p>With this difference, however, in the extremes.</p>

<p>The French boaster is noisy and talkative.
With his mustache twirled defiantly upward,
his hat on one side, he will shout at you, at
the top of his voice that,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "<i>La France, Mon<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 58]</span>sieur,
sera toujours la Fr-r-rance, les Fran&ccedil;ais
seront toujours les Fr-r-ran&ccedil;ais.</i>" As you listen
to him, you are almost tempted to believe,
with Thackeray, "that the poor fellow has a
lurking doubt in his own mind that he is not
the wonder he professes to be."</p>

<p>But allow me to say that the British specimen
is far more provoking. He is so sure that
all his geese are swans; so thoroughly persuaded
of his superiority over the rest of the
human race; it is, in his eyes, such an incon<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 59]</span>tested
and incontestable fact, that he does not
think it worth his while to raise his voice in
asserting it, and that is what makes him so
awfully irritating, "don't you know?" He has
not a doubt that the whole world was made
for him; not only this one, but the next. In
the meantime&mdash;for he is in no hurry to put on
the angel plumage that awaits him&mdash;he congratulates
himself on his position here below.
Everything is done to add to his comfort and
happiness: the Italians give him concerts, the
French dig the Suez Canal for him, the Germans
sweep out his offices and do his errands in the
City of London for $200 a year, the Greeks grow
the principal ingredient in his plum pudding.
The Americans supply his aristocracy with rich
heiresses, so that they may get their coats of
arms out of pawn. His face beams with gratitude
and complacency, as he quietly rubs his
hands together, and calmly thanks Heaven that
he is not as other men are. And it is true
enough; he is not.</p>

<p>"Dear brother reader," says Thackeray,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 60]</span>
"answer as a man of honor. Do you think a
Frenchman your equal? You don't, you gallant
British snob, you know you don't....
Oh, my country! if I were a Frenchman, how
I would hate you!"</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>There is one great difference between our
two boasters: the Englishman will seek, on all
occasions, to appear a trifle better than he
really is&mdash;he never runs himself down; if he has
a defect or two, he will let you find them out;
but the Frenchman, on the contrary, is a braggart
of vice. To hear him joke about matrimony,
for instance, you would take him for a
libertine. To listen to some of the plays that
he will applaud, to see the caricatures that
amuse him, you might come to the conclusion
that, in his eyes, marriage was not a sacred tie.
But do not form your conclusions too hastily.
Those jokes, that delight him, are often in
very doubtful taste, I admit; but they are
jokes and nothing more, and if you were to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 61]</span>
take the plays and caricatures for real pictures
of French life, you would be making as great a
mistake as you could well make.</p>

<p>Now, a Frenchman, who had given an appointment
to his wife, would be apt to take on
a little look of mystery as he hurried away
from a friend in the street, with the words:
"Excuse my haste, I must leave you; I have
an appointment." And if you heard the response,
"Ah! you rascal, I'll tell your wife,"
accompanied by a knowing shake of the head,
you might rashly take the pair for a couple of
reprobates. But once more you would be
wrong. Such harmless trivialities&mdash;for trivialities
they must be called&mdash;are indulged in by
men who are the honor and joy of their homes.</p>

<p>Let me tell you this: Whenever you hear a
Frenchman speak ill of himself, do not believe
him, he is merely boasting. Be sure that
nothing is more true. I shall never say anything
more true so long as I live.</p>

<p>We French hide our virtues and do not like
to be reproached with them. On this subject<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 62]</span>
I might tell an anecdote which, if venerable, is
none the less amusing.</p>

<p>The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, a paper written by the <i>&eacute;lite</i>
of the literary, scientific, and artistic worlds,
was at a loss to know, not long since, why
almost all the heroes of French novels were
engineers. The reason is that French engineers
are all ex-pupils of the Polytechnic
School. I mean the engineers of mines, roads,
and bridges. These young men, having
passed their youth in study, in order to prepare
for the most difficult examination we
have, naturally have the reputation of being
steady. The anecdote is this: Edmond About
one day wrote: "Virtuous as a Polytechnician."
The sentence displeased the young
mathematicians, and they promptly took the
author of it to task.</p>

<p>I forget the exact words of their reply, but
it ran, as nearly as I can recollect:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Dear Sir</i>: Please to speak of what you
know something about. We are no more virtuous
than you."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>And I can vouch for the truth of this little
anecdote: I was one of those who signed the
letter.</p>

<p>Call a Frenchman a "good father" or "good
citizen," he will smile and probably answer
back, "You humbug!" Yet he <i>is</i> a good father
and a good citizen, and he used to be a good
<i>garde-national</i>, notwithstanding his objection
to be told so. He proved it during the siege
of Paris, although his wife had never been able
to look at him in his uniform without laughing.</p>

<p>Now, if the Englishman, who ornaments his
buttonhole with a piece of blue ribbon, does
not put on two pieces more to proclaim <i>urbi
et orbi</i> that he is a good father and a good
citizen, it is because the idea never occurred to
him&mdash;for nobody doubts that, like his neighbor,
he, too, is a good father and a good
citizen.</p>

<p>Ah! I say once more, if we only knew how
to hide our faults as we can hide our virtues,
what a respectable figure we could cut by the
side of our neighbors!<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The English hypocrite is the hypocrite of
virtue and religion. English novelists have
exposed him, but have not succeeded in extinguishing
him; the Chadbands, the Stigginses,
the Podsnaps, the Pecksniffs, all the saintly
British <i>Tartuffes</i>, are as flourishing as ever.</p>

<p>Moli&egrave;re could, in his times, put on the stage
such a man as <i>Tartuffe</i>; at the present day the
type is extinct; the religious hypocrite would
not go down in France; the character is exploded.</p>

<p>Pecksniff, one of the most powerful creations
of Dickens, a photograph from the life, had
named his two daughters, Mercy and Charity.
In France, this worthy father and the Misses
Mercy and Charity would find every door shut
in their faces. This kind of vocation would
lead straight to the workhouse.</p>

<p>It is not that we have no hypocrites, however.
We keep the article, but it is of a different
pattern.</p>

<p>The French hypocrite is the hypocrite of
sentiment&mdash;the crocodile.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>It is natural enough that it should be so.</p>

<p>The hypocrite does but force the characteristic
note of his race. The English are religious
(I mean church-going), the French sentimental;
therefore, the English hypocrite is the
hypocrite of religion, and the French hypocrite
is the hypocrite of sentiment.</p>

<p>The former will enter into conversation with
you by expressing a hope that you do not
concern yourself too much with the things of
this world. Chadband presents himself at the
house of a friend with the salutation: "Peace
be upon this house." Then, seeing the table
garnished with good things, he cries: "My
friends, why must we eat? To live. And
why must we live? To do good. It is then
right that we should eat. Therefore, let us
partake of the good things which are set
before us." Thereupon he gorges himself,
that he may be able the better to support
life, and do the more good. No French novelist
would dare portray such a personage in his
books.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>The French hypocrite proceeds differently.
He makes professions of friendship for you,
embraces you, enters into your woes with
touching displays of feeling; when occasion
seems to require, he can shed a few tears, his
lachrymal gland is inexhaustible. As he takes
his departure, he "hopes things will soon look
brighter," and offers you a cigar.</p>

<p>It is at the funeral of a good bequeathing
uncle that he is especially edifying. He follows,
with staggering steps, the remains of the
beloved defunct; he is literally supported to
the grave by the two friends on whose arms
he leans. Tears trickle down his cheeks,
he is pale and exhausted. His handkerchief
has a wide black border, but smells
of musk. He tells you, with sobs, that his
uncle was a father to him, and begs you to
excuse him, if he finds it impossible to master
his grief.</p>

<p>On arriving home, he writes to his upholsterer
to order new furniture.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>The two kinds of hypocrisy, one as loathsome
as the other, are clearly manifested even
in the criminals of the two countries.</p>

<p>The English prisoner at the bar is not submitted
to examination, and thus the public is
spared his professions of faith; but the letters
he writes to his friends, and to which the newspapers
generally give publicity, show him in
his true light. "He believes in God; he knows
that Heaven will not fail to confound the
infernal machinations of the wretches who
accuse him."</p>

<p>The French criminal makes professions of
sentiment in the dock.</p>

<p>I extract the following lines from the trial of
the vile assassins of Mme. Ballerich:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Q.</i> You loitered about the house and
asked Mme. Ballerich for a fictitious person,
in order to take stock of the premises, did you
not?</p>

<p>"<i>A.</i> I do not deny that I meant to commit<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 68]</span>
a theft, but a crime was far from my thoughts.
A crime is going too far; I would not dishonor
my family; I swear it by my mother.</p>

<p>"<i>Q.</i> You struck the fatal blow that killed
the victim. When you left she was still alive?</p>

<p>"<i>A.</i> I did not look to see whether Mme.
Ballerich was dead. It is bad enough to be
mixed up at all in affairs of that kind! It
made me feel sick to see the blood. I suffered
internally; I was struck with remorse and
repentance and I thought of my mother.
(Here the prisoner burst into tears.)"</p></div>

<p>The English assassin, on mounting the scaffold,
generally gives his friends <i>rendezvous</i> in
the better land, and implores his Maker's pardon.
The French murderer implores the
pardon of his mother.</p>

<p>At this solemn moment both of them probably
cease to be hypocrites.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>FRENCH AND ENGLISH SOCIAL FAILURES.</h3>


<p>The French social failure is generally a radical.
If he had cared to do as plenty of others
do (and seeing you prosperous, he accompanies
this with an expressive glance), if he had cared
to intrigue and curry favor, he too could have
cut a figure in the world. But unhappily for
himself, he does not know how to disguise his
opinions; he is, according to the formula, poor
but honest.</p>

<p>It is his pride that leads him to avoid the
lucky ones of the earth; he has no desire to be
taken for a schemer. If he has lost all else,
honor still is left, and this, his only remaining
treasure, he intends to preserve intact.</p>

<p>He despises money, and if he does not
return that little loan he borrowed of you, it is<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 70]</span>
because he presumes that your contempt for
filthy lucre is equal to his own.</p>

<p>Yet the sight of gold melts him, and there
flits across his face a smile of satisfaction,
mingled, however, with a tinge of sadness at
the thought of being caught capitulating with
the enemy. But to convince himself that he
has lost none of his independence of character,
he goes straightway and says evil of you, so
that no man shall say of him that he was corrupted
by the loan of a paltry coin.</p>

<p>You will generally find that he has been
bankrupt once or twice; but as that has not
made a rich man of him, you conclude that, if
he has not a great love of money, neither has
he a great talent for business.</p>

<p>He lays his poverty at everyone's door but
his own. Society does not understand him.
He shall go to his grave without having had
a chance of revealing himself to the world.
Meanwhile he opens a general agency. Not
having been successful with his own affairs, he
hopes to have better luck with other people's.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>As a rule, you find that he has married a
servant or a laundress, "to pay a debt he owed
to Society," as he puts it. But Society, who
is but a thankless jade, turns her back upon
him and his wife. Never mind, he has done
his duty. Upon this point he finds nothing to
reproach himself with. Some men marry for
money; thank Heaven, he is not one of that sort.</p>

<p>Let anything you undertake prove a success,
and you will hear him say that he had
thought of doing it long ago; it was only his
idea stolen from him. But there's the rub;
what is the use of ideas, when one has no
capital?</p>

<p>And, instead of setting to work to get a
capital, he writes anonymous letters.</p>

<p>He occasionally talks of committing suicide,
of throwing himself into the sea; but this idea
of his has been stolen so many times over that
he gives it up in disgust.</p>

<p>When he does die, it will be of spite.</p>

<p>You will survive the loss of him without
difficulty.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>His presence is a hair in your soup, a crumb
in your bed.</p>

<p>The French social failure is not uncommonly
a philosopher, and even keeps a spark
of facetiousness through all his misfortunes.</p>

<p>About ten years ago, I was talking one day
with a Frenchman, who had been established
in England some time. <i>Established!</i> I am
getting facetious, too, you see.</p>

<p>I was erroneously maintaining to him that
imprisonment was still inflicted in England for
debt.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, I can assure you," said
he.</p>

<p>"I do not think so," I replied.</p>

<p>"Imprisonment for debt was abolished two
years ago."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure?" said I, seeing him so
positive.</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu!</i> I ought to know better than
you," he said. "I was the last to come out."</p>

<p>The English social failure is much more
humble than his like in France, for the simple<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 73]</span>
reason that, in France, poverty is no crime,
while in England, as in America, it is. Apart
from this the two types do not differ much.</p>

<p>In the commercial world, the English social
failure is an agent of some sort; generally
wine or coal. In the exercise of his calling, he
requires no capital, nor even a cellar. He not
unfrequently entitles himself <i>General Agent</i>:
this, when the wreck is at hand. Such are the
straws he clutches at; if they should break, he
sinks, and is heard of no more, unless his wife
comes to the rescue, by setting up a lodging
house or a boarding school for young ladies.
There, once more in smooth water, he wields
the blacking brush, makes acquaintance with
the knife board, or gets in the provisions. In
allowing himself to be kept by his wife, he
feels he loses some dignity, but if she should
adopt any airs of superiority over him, he can
always bring her to a sense of duty by beating
her.</p>

<p>In the republics of art and letters, you generally
find him playing the part of critic, con<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 74]</span>soling
himself for his failures by abusing the
artists who sell their pictures, or the authors
who sell their books. For these he knows no
pity. He can all the more easily abuse his
dear brethren of the quill or brush that he has
not to sign his invectives; his prose is anonymous.
Once a week, in the columns of some
penny paper, he can, with perfect impunity,
relieve his heart of the venom it contains.</p>

<p>The mud he scatters has one good quality&mdash;it
does not stain; one fillip ... and it is
gone.</p>

<p>Here is a sample of this kind of production.
I extract it from a paper as pretentious as it is
little read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The fortunate writer woke up one morning
to find himself famous, and his book on a tide
of popularity which carried it, in one year,
through some fifty editions. A grand stroke
of this kind insures the ambition to repeat
it.... His new book bears throughout
manifest evidences of having been scrambled<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 75]</span>
through, and put together anyhow, in order to
recapture the notice <i>and the money of the
public</i>."</p></div>

<p>Now Carlyle, who was very sensitive to
adverse criticism, used to call these revengeful
failures in literature "dirty puppies," and it
was kind of him to so far notice them.</p>

<p>But if I were the author in question, an
answer somewhat in the following style would
rise to my pen:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>My Dear Sir</i>: I admire your independence
and your contempt for the money and the
favors of the public. But one question I would
ask of you: Why do you send your invectives to
the wrong address? If I am famous, as you are
pleased to say, without believing it any more
than myself, do not lay the blame upon me, my
dear sir; lay it rather upon that 'fool of a public'
who is silly enough to prefer my scribblings to
your <i>chefs-d'&#339;uvre</i>. Not for the world would
I say anything that might be disagreeable to
you, but I would fain remind you that, ever
since the days of Horace, the authors of books<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 76]</span>
that sell have never been appreciated by the
authors of the books that do not."</p></div>

<p>The bitterness of Mr. Tommy Hawk's criticisms
forms a curious contrast with the fairness
and good-nature of the serious English critic.</p>

<p>The latter possesses a large stock of good
sense, good taste, learning, and independence.
He can blend counsel and encouragement, and
he has a conscience; that is to say, as much
aversion to disparaging as to flattering. The
same author whom he praised yesterday because
his work was worthy of praise, he
blames to-day because his work is deserving of
blame; he is no respecter of persons.</p>

<p>Criticism should be taken with thanks and
deference, if fair and kind; with deference and
no thanks, if fair but unkind; with silence and
contempt, if insulting and unfair.</p>

<p>So says D'Alembert.</p>

<p>Mr. George Augustus Sala, the wittiest and
best-humored of English journalists, in one of
his interesting <i>Echoes of the Week</i>, not long
ago accused a book of my own, after paying it
one or two compliments, of being as full of
blunders as an egg is full of meat.</p>

<h3>HIGH-LIFE ANGLO-FRENCH GIBBERISH AS USED
IN FRANCE AND IN ENGLAND.</h3>


<p>Languages have this in common with many
mortals; when they borrow they do not
return. This is perhaps a happy thing, for
when borrowed words do get returned, good
Heavens! what a state they come home in!</p>

<p>We thought we were doing a fine thing in
taking the words <i>ticket</i>, <i>jockey</i>, <i>budget</i>, <i>tunnel</i>,
<i>fashion</i> from the English. They are, however,
but French words mutilated, and there is not
much to be proud of in reacquiring them.
The English had borrowed of us <i>&eacute;tiqueter,
jacquet</i> (<i>petit Jacques</i>), <i>bougette</i> (<i>the king's privy
purse</i>), <i>fa&ccedil;on</i>. Better they had kept them.
Up to the nineteenth century, it was by reason
of war and conquest that both conquerors and
conquered saw their vocabularies invaded by<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 80]</span>
foreign words; but is it not strange that in the
nineteenth century, the century of civilization,
so-called, peace between England and France
should bring about such a disastrous result?</p>

<p>Formerly we used to <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>.</p>

<p><i>Nous avons chang&eacute; tout cela</i>; nowadays <i>nous
lunchons</i>. <i>Nous lunchons!</i> What a barbarous
mouthful, is it not?</p>

<p>The word <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> signifying "to cease fasting,"
or, as the English say, "to breakfast," it
is wrongly used in speaking of a second repast.
<i>D&eacute;jeuner</i> is, therefore, irrational; but is this
any excuse for making ourselves grotesque?</p>

<p>But, my dear compatriots, we are avenged.
I read in the London <i>Standard</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Prince Albert Victor was yesterday admitted
to the freedom of the City of London....
The royal party and a large company
of invited guests were afterward entertained
at a <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> in the Guildhall, the Lord
Mayor presiding."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>Now that the French <i>lunch</i>, the English
will <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> more than ever, of course.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Parisian good society no longer takes tea, it
"five o'clocks"; and the <i>bourgeois</i> is beginning
to put at the foot of his cards of invitation:</p>

<p>"<i>On five o'clockera &agrave; neuf heures.</i>"</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>When the English wish to have a song or a
piece of music repeated by an artist, they
shout: <i>Encore!</i> And, the following day, the
papers, in their accounts of the performance,
announce that Mademoiselle So-and-So was
<i>encored</i>.</p>

<p>While I am upon this subject, allow me to
give you a little sample of modern English;
it will prove to you that Alexander Dumas
was right, when he pronounced English to be
only French badly pronounced, and I would
add, badly spelt:<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>"The <i>concert</i> was <i>brilliant</i>, and the <i>ensemble
excellent</i>. Miss N&mdash;&mdash; was <i>encored</i>, but Mr.
D&mdash;&mdash;, who made his <i>d&eacute;but</i>, only obtained a
<i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>."</p>

<p>Go to Trafalgar Square. Place yourself at
the foot of that long Roman candle, on the
summit of which the statue of Nelson may be
perceived ... on a clear day. Turn toward
the Palace of Westminster, and you will see
on your left the <i>Grand H&ocirc;tel</i> and the <i>Avenue
Theatre</i>, on your right the <i>H&ocirc;tel M&eacute;tropole</i>.
In your rear you will find the <i>National Gallery</i>.
As all these buildings are within a hundred
yards of Charing Cross station, the terminus at
which you alight on coming from France, your
first impression will be that it will not take
you long to learn to speak English. Ah!
dear compatriots, be not deceived; you little
guess the terrible perfidiousness of that language.
Those provoking Britons seem to
have taken a wicked pleasure in inventing a
collection of unheard-of sounds, a pronunciation
that will fill your hearts with despair, and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 83]</span>
that puts them quite out of the reach of imitation.</p>

<p>Thou mayest dress like an Englishman, dear
compatriot, eat roast beef like an Englishman,
but, never, never wilt thou speak English like
an Englishman. Thou wilt always massacre
his language; let this console thee for hearing
him massacre thine.</p>

<p>In the <i>Spectator</i> of the 8th of September,
1711, Addison wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have often wished, that as in our Constitution
there are several persons whose business
it is to watch over our laws, our liberties, and
commerce, certain men might be set apart as
superintendents of our language, to hinder any
words of a foreign coin from passing among
us; and, in particular, to prohibit any French
phrases from becoming current in this kingdom,
when those of our stamp are altogether
as valuable. The present war has so adulterated
our tongue with strange words, that it
would be impossible for one of our grand<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 84]</span>fathers
to know what his posterity have been
doing, were he to read their exploits in a modern
newspaper."</p></div>

<p>Oh, Addison, stop thy ears, and veil thy face!</p>

<p>M. Hippolyte Cocheris, the learned French
philologist, quotes, in one of his writings, a
piece of prose from an aristocratic pen, which
appeared in No. 116 of the <i>New Monthly</i>. It
runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I was <i>chez moi</i>, inhaling the <i>odeur musqu&eacute;e</i>
of my scented <i>boudoir</i>, when the Prince of
Z&mdash;&mdash; entered. He found me in my <i>demi-toilette,
blas&eacute;e sur tout</i>, and pensively engaged
in solitary conjugation of the verb <i>s'ennuyer</i>,
and though he had never been one of my <i>habitu&eacute;s</i>,
or by any means <i>des n&ocirc;tres</i>, I was not
inclined at this moment of <i>d&eacute;lassement</i> to glide
with him into the <i>crocchio restretto</i> of familiar
chat."</p></div>

<p>To edify his readers, and make them appreciate
this little masterpiece of hybrid style at<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 85]</span>
its due value, M. Cocheris proceeds to translate
the piece into French, carefully replacing
all the words in italics by English ones, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>J'&eacute;tais <i>at home</i>, aspirant la <i>musky smell</i> de
mon <i>private room</i>, lorsque le Prince de Z&mdash;&mdash;
entra. Il me trouva en simple <i>dress</i>, <i>fatigued
with everything</i>, tristement occup&eacute; &agrave; conjuguer
le verbe <i>to be weary</i>, et quoique je ne
l'eusse jamais compt&eacute; au nombre de mes <i>intimates</i>,
et qu'il ne f&ucirc;t, en aucune fa&ccedil;on <i>of our
set</i>, j'&eacute;tais assez dispos&eacute;e &agrave; entrer avec lui dans
le <i>crocchio restretto</i> d'une causerie famili&egrave;re.</p></div>

<p>M. H. Cocheris maintains that a French
author would never dare to have recourse to
such a literary proceeding. Nonsense! Read
our novels, read our newspapers. At every
page, you find mention made of <i>fashionables</i> in
<i>knickerbockers</i>, who, dressed in <i>ulsters</i>, repair to
the <i>turf</i> in a <i>dogcart</i> with a <i>groom</i> and a <i>bulldog</i>.
They bring up at a <i>bar</i> and eat a slice of
<i>pudding</i> or a <i>sandwich</i>, washed down with a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 86]</span>
bowl of <i>punch</i> or a <i>cocktail</i>. These gentlemen
have the <i>spleen</i>, in spite of the <i>comfortable</i> life
they lead. In the evening, they go and applaud
the <i>humor</i> of a <i>clown</i>, and call <i>snobs</i>
those who prefer the <i>Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise</i>.</p>

<p>If this picture of the state of things be
really a true one, the French Academy, which
was founded to look after the mother tongue
of Moli&egrave;re, had better lower its blinds and
burn tapers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>HUMOR, WIT, AND HIBERNIANISM.</h3>


<p>Humor is a subtle, witty, philosophical, and
greatly satirical form of gayety, the outcome of
simplicity in the character, that is met chiefly
among English-speaking people.</p>

<p>Humor has not the brilliancy, the vivacity
of French wit, but it is more graceful, lighter,
and above all more philosophic. A sarcastic
element is nearly always present in it, and not
unfrequently a vein of sadness. There is
something deliciously quiet and deliberate
about humor, that is in perfect harmony with
the English character; and we have been right
in adopting the English name for the thing,
seeing that the thing is essentially English.</p>

<p>Germany has produced humorists, among
whom Hoffman and Henry Heine shine conspicuously;
but this kind of playful raillery<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 88]</span>
is not to be met with in French literature,
except perhaps in the <i>Lettres provinciales</i> of
Pascal.</p>

<p>In France, irony is presented in a more
lively form. Swift and Sterne are the acknowledged
masters of British humor, as
Rabelais and Voltaire are the personification
of French wit.</p>

<p>British humor does not evaporate so quickly
as French wit; you feel its influence longer.
The latter takes you by storm, but humor
lightly tickles you under the ribs, and quietly
takes possession of you by degrees; the bright
idea, instead of being laid bare, is subtly hidden;
it is only after you have peeled off the
coating of sarcasm lying on the surface, that
you get at the fun underneath.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>I believe Parisian wit might be correctly
described as a sudden perception and expression
of a likeness in the unlike. Here is an
example of it; an English one:<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Sydney Smith, the most Parisian wit England
has produced, one day asked the Corporation
of the City of London to pave St. Paul's
Churchyard with wood. The Corporation
replied that such a thing was perfectly impracticable.</p>

<p>"Not at all, gentlemen, I assure you," cried
Sydney Smith; "you have only to lay all your
heads together, and the thing is done."</p>

<p>This is a specimen of French wit in English.</p>

<p>Sarcasm is one of the most important and
frequent ingredients in French wit.</p>

<p>Voltaire is the personification of that kind
of wit; but other countries have produced men
whose wit he should have had the modesty of
calling "as good as French." England is foremost
among those countries. Douglas Jerrold,
Sydney Smith, Sheridan, Lord Eldon, had
they been born in France, would have been
called French wits.</p>

<p>Two anecdotes of these men, to illustrate the
point.</p>

<p>Sheridan's son one day came to his father<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 90]</span>
and announced that he would be a candidate
for Parliament.</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Sheridan, "and what are your
colors?"</p>

<p>"I have none," said the son, "I am independent,
and belong to no party. I will stick
on my forehead: '<i>To be let</i>.'"</p>

<p>"Good," said Sheridan, "and under that, put
'<i>Unfurnished</i>.'"</p>

<p>Lord Eldon was a great sufferer from gout.
A sympathizing lady friend had made him a
beautiful pair of very large slippers to wear
when his enemy troubled him.</p>

<p>One day his servant came to him, and announced
that the lovely slippers were gone,
and had been stolen.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lord Eldon, "I hope they will
fit the rascal."</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>That kind of wit, peculiar to the Irish, and
commonly called Hibernianism, is an apparent
congruity in things essentially incongruous.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 91]</span>
In fact, it expresses what is apparently rational,
but in reality utterly irrational.</p>

<p>Thus, when an Irishman was told that one
of Dr. Arnott's patent stoves would save half
the usual fuel, he exclaimed to his wife: "Arrah!
thin I'll buy two and save it all, my
jewel."</p>

<p>We have nothing in French wit that can
properly be compared to Hibernianism, except
perhaps the <i>gasconnade</i> at times, but in the
<i>gasconnade</i> there is no humor, the essence of it
is exaggeration.</p>

<p>"You often forget to close the shutters of
the ground-floor rooms at night," an Irishman
would say to his servant; "one of these fine
mornings I shall wake up murdered in my
bed." I do not know that friend Paddy has
ever perpetrated this one, but he is quite capable
of it.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>During the famous Michelstown Inquiry, Pat
Casey was examined. He had seen the affray,
hidden behind a wall.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>"Was that brave, to hide behind a wall?"
said the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Well, sor," said Pat, "better be a coward
for foive minutes than to be dead for the rest
of your loife."</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The Hibernianism is one of the forms of
laziness of the mind, but it is not at all a proof
of stupidity. On the contrary, all those jokes
that the English are fond of putting to the
credit of the Irish, are only the proof of a
certain overflow of intelligence, two ideas issuing
simultaneously from the brain, and getting
confused into one. Dissect a Hibernianism,
and you will generally find two ideas, perfectly
sensible, but not agreeing together.</p>

<p>I have met with just as many noodles in
England as elsewhere. But among all the
Irish that I have come across, though some
have been lazy, and many have been bunglers,
I have not yet met one who was not intelligent,
amiable, and witty.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>While on this subject, I might remind the
English of the remark made once by their celebrated
critic, John Ruskin, at Oxford: "English
jokes are often tame, but there is always
wit at the bottom of an Irish bull."</p>

<p>And we might add:</p>

<p>Burke, the greatest English orator that ever
lived, was an Irishman. Excuse, I beg, this
Hibernianism of mine.</p>

<p>Lord Dufferin, that ambassador, and Lord
Wolseley, that <i>only</i> general, whom England
has been serving for the past few years, roast,
baked, and boiled, to her friends and foes
alike, the two saviors to whom she invariably
turns when anything is going wrong ... or
is wanted to go wrong, are sons of Erin.</p>

<p>Goldsmith, the immortal author of the
"Vicar of Wakefield," was Irish.</p>

<p>Sheridan, the author of the "School for
Scandal," that the English might almost call
their <i>only</i> comedy, was Irish.</p>

<p>Jonathan Swift and Richard Steele were
Irish.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>The names of Ireland's great men would fill
a long list.</p>

<p>One might almost say that all that is most
delicate and most witty in English literature is
of Irish origin.</p>

<p>When we have added that the Duke of
Wellington was an Irishman, perhaps we shall
have succeeded in showing that England is
very far yet from having paid her little debt of
gratitude to Ireland.</p>

<h3>THE MAL DE MER.</h3>


<p>To think that those worthy French and English
people, who only live twenty-one miles
from each other, should not be able to exchange
visits without first making acquaintance
with the <i>mal de mer</i>! To think that this
must be the last impression that each one takes
home with him!</p>

<p>The <i>mal de mer</i>! That uninteresting complaint
which awakes no pity in the breast of
man!</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The sky is serene, a light breeze gently fans
your cheek, the water in the harbor is as
smooth as a sheet of glass. You timidly ask
the first sailor you come across a question or
two as to the weather and the outlook for the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 96]</span>
passage&mdash;not for your own reassurance, for
<i>you</i> are a pretty good sailor, but ... for a
friend, or ... for a lady who is traveling
with you, and who suffers dreadfully from
seasickness. The sly fellow sees through your
little ruse, and answers, with a serio-comic
look: "The sea, sir! like a lake, sir; like a
lake."</p>

<p>You feel reassured. You say to yourself:
"Well, this time, at all events, we shall have
a good passage;" and you cheerily pace the
deck, light of heart and firm of foot, convinced
that if anyone is ill, it will not be you.</p>

<p>The illusion is a sweet, but short-lived one.</p>

<p>The whistle sounds, the boat is set in
motion, and gently and smoothly glides to the
mouth of the harbor.</p>

<p>Everyone seems in the best of spirits, people
chatter in groups, and handkerchiefs are
waved to the friends who have come down to
the quay to see you off.</p>

<p>The end of the pier is passed. There you
are&mdash;now for it. You have hardly rounded<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 97]</span>
the projection which would be for you a little
Cape of Good Hope, if you were only arriving
instead of departing, when the horrible construction
heaves heavily forward, and then
seems to sink away from under your feet, making
you feel as if it were about to leave you in
mid-air, and trust to your intelligence to catch
it again. You would fain make your escape
without delay; but everybody is there, so you
hold on and look around. Little by little the
faces grow serious; they begin to pale and
lengthen visibly; the groups melt and gradually
disperse. Everyone finds a pretext for
going below and hiding his shame.</p>

<p>"I am not generally ill on the water," you
remark to your neighbor; "but to-day, I don't
know why, I am not feeling quite up to the
mark; I must have eaten something at luncheon
that does not agree with me.... Oh!
of course, it's that wretched lobster salad! I
was cautioned not to touch it, too. Oh! <i>la
gourmandise!</i>" Confident of having persuaded
your traveling companion that you are a toler<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 98]</span>ably
good sailor, you too disappear below
... and he, not sorry to see you go, is not
long in following your example.</p>

<p>You go down to the cabin. Alas! that is
the finishing touch. The stuffy, heavy, unwholesome
atmosphere, charged with a mixed
odor of tar, mysterious cookery, and troubled
stomachs, brings your digestive apparatus up
to your throat. You feel stifled. All the
vital forces crowd to your head, and your legs
are powerless to support you. You throw
yourself on your berth like a log, and instinctively
close your eyes, so as not to see that man
over there, who is just about to open the ball,
or that other who is looking at you with a
mixture of amusement and pity, as he calmly
eats his chop. This creature is the most
annoying of all your fellow-passengers. His
compassion for you is insulting. You hate his
healthy-looking face, his calm, his good appetite
even; and your indignation reaches its
climax when you see him coolly filling his pipe
and preparing to go on deck and smoke. Un<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 99]</span>able
to endure the atmosphere of the saloon
any longer, you make a grand effort and
return to the upper regions. The first sight
that meets your eyes is that man again, now
lavishing the most careful attentions upon
your wife; he has been to fetch her some
brandy and water, or a cup of tea. You would
thank him, but you do not care for your wife
to see you in your pitiful condition. That
fellow is unbearable, overpowering. This is
the only reflection suggested by his kindness
to your wife; and away you steer, making a
semicircle, or rather two or three, on your way
to an empty bench, where you once more
assume the horizontal.</p>

<p>A friend comes to tell you that your wife is
giving up the ghost somewhere in the stern of
the ship, but you make believe not to hear,
and only murmur through your teeth: "So am
I; what can I do for her?"</p>

<p>You ask the steward to send you some tea,
and it comes up in an earthenware basin an
inch thick. You put it to your lips. Horri<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 100]</span>ble!
What can it possibly be made of, this
nauseating decoction? The smell of the flat,
unpalatable stuff makes you feel more qualmish
than ever; the remedy is worse than the
evil.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Just as, at Monaco, you never fail to
come across a gambler who has his system,
you rarely take a sea journey without meeting
with the good soul who has an infallible preventive
for seasickness. "This succeeds with
nine persons out of ten," she tells you. Next
time you cross, you try it, but only to find
that you are evidently <i>the tenth</i>. However, it
is not a failure or two that can shake the
blind confidence she has in her remedy, I must
say it to her credit.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Though there exists no cure for this strange
evil, I think, notwithstanding, that by the
exercise of a little self-control, one can retard<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 101]</span>
the catastrophe. At least such is my experience.</p>

<p>We were one day between Guernsey and
Southampton, just near the Casquettes, where
the Channel makes things very uncomfortable
for you, if there is the least wind blowing. I
had curled myself up in a corner in the stern
of the boat and was preparing to feel very
sadly. Up came two French ladies, appearing,
like myself, to have strayed that way in
search of solitude.</p>

<p>"<i>Saperlotte</i>," thought I, "here are women
looking at you, my boy; be a man."</p>

<p>I fixed my eyes on a point of the horizon,
and no doubt appeared to my neighbors to be
plunged in profound contemplation.</p>

<p>The ladies took up their position not very
far from me, and began to heave very heavy
sighs. I looked at them. They were green.</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur!" said one of them to me,
"how fortunate you are, not to be ill!"</p>

<p>I was saved, for the moment at all events.
It put fresh strength into me. Forcing a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 102]</span>
smile, and gathering up my courage, I had the
impudence to affirm that I felt pretty well.
The effort of the will had the power to keep
the evil in check.</p>

<p>At that moment I understood how you can
make a hero of a frightened soldier by telling
him that bravery is written in his eyes.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>A man who crosses the Channel several
times a year is pretty sure to have one or two
little anecdotes of the <i>mal de mer</i>, and its consequences,
in a corner of his memory.</p>

<p>Here is one chosen at random:</p>

<p>It was between Boulogne and Folkestone,
on a <i>mare contrarium</i>.</p>

<p>Seated quietly on deck, I was just dozing
over a book, the author of which I will not
name, since his volume had less power over
my senses than the rolling of the boat. I was
presently brought back to consciousness by
the weight of a head, laid on my shoulder.
I opened my eyes, looked out of the corners<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 103]</span>
of them; the head was a very pretty one,
upon my word.</p>

<p>What was I to do?</p>

<p>To stay would be compromising; to get
away suddenly would be ungallant and perhaps
not without danger, for the poor little
head might fall against the bulwarks of the
boat. I reclosed my eyes, and made believe
not to have noticed anything. All at once I
heard a sweet voice in my ear:</p>

<p>"O Arthur! What shall I do? If you
only knew how sick I feel. Oh! I must lean
my head on your shoulder; you don't mind,
do you?"</p>

<p>The situation was getting alarming. I kept
my eyes closed, so as not to scare away the
poor creature, who was evidently at sea, in
more senses than one. I kept quiet, buried in
my wraps and traveling cap, and, without moving
my head, just murmured, "I am really
awfully sorry, madam, but I am not Arthur."</p>

<p>This was startling enough in all conscience.
I quite expected a small explosion; apologies,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 104]</span>
little screams, a fainting fit, perhaps. Happily,
however, on board ship, dignity is laid
aside. Certainly, on dry land, this lady could
not have done less than faint, if it were only
for the sake of appearances. But <i>&agrave; la mer,
comme &agrave; la mer</i>.</p>

<p>So there was no fuss or fainting; for that
matter my poor fellow-traveler had not the
strength to move. I rose, helped her to assume
a more comfortable position, placed a
cushion under her head, and covered her with
my rug. Then, having called the steward
and recommended Mme. Arthur to his care,
there remained nothing but to decamp, and
quit the thankless <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of caretaker of somebody
else's wife.</p>

<p>When we got into harbor at Folkestone,
Arthur suddenly made his appearance from
somewhere in the lower regions. He was
my very double&mdash;the same size, the same
dress.... I saw through the misadventure.</p>

<p>On joining the London train, I found myself
in the same compartment as the young<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 105]</span>
couple. Arthur <i>knew all</i>, as they say in sensational
novels, and we had a hearty laugh
together over the affair. Arthur was as gay as
a lark. I attributed his mirth to the fact of
his having left the sea behind, and to his finding
himself once more on <i>terra firma</i> with his
beloved one. I found in the course of conversation
that he had only been married the day
before, and the happy pair had come over to
hide their bliss in the fogs. They intended
passing their honeymoon in London. It
would have been sacrilege. I dissuaded them
from their project, and induced them to go to
Scotland, to see its lakes and mountains, and
the bracken lit up with autumnal gold.</p>

<h3>BRITISH PHILOSOPHY AND FRENCH SENSITIVENESS.</h3>


<p>British philosophy!</p>

<p>Why not <i>English Philosophy</i>?</p>

<p>The difference is enormous. If I were to
publish a treatise on the English philosophers,
Bacon, Locke, Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer,
Frederic Harrison, etc., I should call my work:
"A Study of English Philosophy." But if I
said to you that the English, not having succeeded
in regaining Khartoum, contented
themselves with regaining the road to England,
I should add, that is British philosophy.</p>

<p>You would not say, "History of British Literature,"
you say, "History of English Literature."</p>

<p>There is something serio-comic about the
word "British," or something chauvinistic.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 108]</span>
You would be right in saying "British army,
British soldiers." The lady who fills the newspapers
with her outcries against the few nudities
exhibited in the Academy every season, is
known only by the name of "British Matron."</p>

<p>An Englishman only calls his fellow-countrymen
"Britons" when he is half laughing at
them. When he says, "We Britons," he is not
quite serious; on the contrary, when he says,
"We Englishmen," his face reflects the feeling
of respect with which the sound of his name
inspires him.</p>

<p>The "English public," is good society; the
"British" public means the common run of
mortals in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>British philosophy! that philosophy that
makes us like what we have when we cannot
have what we like; that philosophy taught by
that good mother, and incomparable teacher,
whose name is Necessity.</p>

<p>Alas, we French people do not possess this
kind of philosophy. I wish we did. As a
matter of fact, we are the most absurdly sensi<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 109]</span>tive,
thin-skinned people on the face of the
earth. We do not know how to take a kick,
much less, make use of it. I mean a kick in
the figurative sense; the one that leaves no
trace, and does not prevent us from sitting at
our ease.</p>

<p>But, if the Englishman knows how to take
it, do you believe he feels it the less for that?
Be not deceived on the point. He exercises
control over himself. He does not give it
back on the spot, but stores it up, rubs the
injured part, applies a little cold cream, if necessary,
and awaits the moment when he will
be able to return it with interest. Such is the
difference between the two men. To my
mind, the Englishman is the more intelligent
of the two.</p>

<p>Success turns our heads in France, reverses
discourage and demoralize us; we know neither
how to profit by victory, nor put up with defeat.
In victory, we see only glory; in defeat,
only disgrace.</p>

<p>Thus we are led to make war to serve dynas<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 110]</span>tic
interests; we go to the Crimea for the
English, who do not go to Germany for us; we
set the Italian nation on its feet, and to-day,
see it, in its profound gratitude, preferring
Germany to ourselves.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Criticism exasperates instead of benefiting
us, and even occasionally amusing us. We
hate our enemies, instead of being grateful to
them for the good they do us; for if we owe
part of our success to our friends, we owe a
still greater part to our enemies.</p>

<p>There are two ways of causing an animal to
advance&mdash;whether that animal be an artist, a
writer, or a prime minister&mdash;first, by kind
encouragements ... in front; secondly, by
something less pleasant ... on the other side.</p>

<p>I firmly believe the second process to be the
more efficient of the two.</p>

<p>It is only indifference that kills; in religion,
in love, in politics, in literature, in everything.</p>

<p>Christianity came out of the Roman arenas,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 111]</span>
English Protestantism out of the Smithfield
fires; and many a demagogue owed his success,
under the Second Empire, to the few
months' imprisonment at Ste. P&eacute;lagie that the
Imperialist judges were silly enough to condemn
him to.</p>

<p>Enemies? Why, they are our fortune.
When I hear a man spoken of after his death
as never having had any enemies, as a Christian
I admire him, but I also come to the conclusion
that the dear fellow must have been a
very insignificant member of the community.</p>

<p>If you do something new, you make enemies
of all the red tapeists; if you do something
intelligent, you make enemies of all the fools;
if you are successful, you make enemies of all
the army of failures, the misunderstood, the
crabbed, and the jealous; but these little outbursts
of hatred, one as diverting as the other,
are really so many testimonials in your favor.</p>

<p>If you send in your application for some
vacant post, and you succeed in obtaining it,
you may be sure that there will be but one<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 112]</span>
candidate who will consider that the election
was made according to merit; yourself. The
rest will cry out in chorus that your luck is
something wonderful. Luck! What a drudge
this poor word is made of! The privations
you have imposed upon yourself, and the long
nights that you have devoted to work, are
<i>luck</i>. <i>Luck</i>, as a great English moralist puts
it, means rising at six in the morning; <i>luck</i>
means spending tenpence when you earn a
shilling; <i>luck</i> means minding your own business
and not meddling with other people's.</p>

<p>The Englishman knows that it falls to everyone's
lot to be criticised, and he makes up his
mind to endure it. He even has a certain
admiration for those who criticise and rally
him, if the operation is performed with a little
dexterity. Violent criticism is the only kind
he has a contempt for. "The fellow loses his
temper," says he; "he is a fool, who proves
that his cause is a bad one;" and he goes on
his way unconcerned. So, while, in Paris, a
Republican and a Bonapartist, who meet on<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 113]</span>
the Boulevards, will look daggers at each
other; a Liberal and a Conservative, who
meet in Pall Mall, will shake hands and go and
dine together amicably. They both know that
it is all humbug. After dinner, they repair to
the House of Commons; one takes his seat on
the left, the other on the right of the Speaker,
who ought rather to be called the <i>Spoken to</i>,
since everyone addresses his remarks to him,
but he very rarely opens his lips.</p>

<p>Never any insults in this Parliament. You
will never hear any such phrase as "the honorable
member has lied," but rather, "the honorable
member has just made a remark which
is scarcely in accordance with strict truth."
These euphemisms are the soul of the English
language, the outcome of the cool British temperament.
Violent language has not the least
power to move an Englishman to wrath&mdash;it
rather excites his pity. In an English club,
two members who had called each other
"liars," would find their names promptly
struck off the roll, and there would be an end<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 114]</span>
of the matter. In France they would fight a
duel.</p>

<p>The following anecdote shows how ready
the English are to acknowledge their little
<i>failings</i>.</p>

<p>I was speaking of the English spirit of
colonization one day at a lecture, and in the
course of my remarks on the subject, I took
the liberty of saying, not without a slight
touch of satire:</p>

<p>"When John Bull makes colonies, it is for the
good of the natives."</p>

<p>"For their goods!" cried a jolly Briton from
the gallery.</p>

<p>He evidently thought me too indulgent.
By the manner in which my interrupter was
applauded, I judged that he had properly
seized and expressed the general feeling of the
audience.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>It is in adversity that the Englishman is to
be admired. If he is defeated, he puts a good<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 115]</span>
face upon it; he accepts his defeat, and makes
the best of it. "I have proved that I can
fight," he says; "why should I fight a hopeless
battle?" If the door must give way to the
burglars, he does not wait for them to break it
open, he opens it himself; if he cannot save
his furniture, he saves his door; it is so much
gained.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>It is thanks to this practical philosophy
that, on the day after an election, you see all
the newspapers express their satisfaction at
the result. The winning side has always
gained a more brilliant, more decisive, victory
than ever, in spite of the enormous difficulties
that had to be overcome. The losing side
invariably gains a moral victory, and this is
proved by <i>a + b</i>.</p>

<p>When, after the defeat at Majuba Hill, England
abandoned the conquest of the Transvaal,
a feat which would have been mere child's play
to her, but which would probably have aroused<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 116]</span>
some indignation in Europe, Mr. Gladstone
announced that, after all, the Boers were only
fighting for their independence, and it was not
seemly for generous England to annex by
force a country that wished to be free, and
had given such proof of valor.</p>

<p>A little masterpiece in its way, this speech!</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>What a strange, ungrateful animal is man!
What respect he has for his conquerors!
What contempt for those he can conquer!
When he speaks of the lion that devours him,
or the eagle that tears his flesh, he is ready to
take off his hat to them; when he speaks of
the donkey that renders him great service,
or of the goose that furnishes him a good
dinner, a pen to write with, and a bed to lie
on, he cannot sufficiently express his contempt.</p>

<p>Do you remember, dear American friends,
how, some four years ago, a certain Lord<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 117]</span>
Sackville, British minister in Washington, was
given twenty-four hours to leave the country?
Never had John Bull been administered a better
kick before. Did he go to war with America?
Oh, no. The prime minister of England
declared that you could not expect "gentlemanly
manners from American politicians,"
and John Bull was satisfied, and he set about
bullying little Portugal about some South
African bit of territory.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>When the Englishman meets with his superior,
he is ready to admit it. If he be jealous
of him, he will not expose himself to ridicule
by showing it. He does not shun the prosperous
man, he cultivates his acquaintance. He
is not necessarily a schemer for that; where
there is no meanness there is no scheming.
He acknowledges all the aristocracies; the
aristocracy of birth, the aristocracy of money,
and the aristocracy of talent; and I only<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 118]</span>
blame him for one thing, which is that he has
much less admiration for the third of these
than for the other two. At a public dinner, in
England, you may see in the places of honor,
on either side of the chairman, one or two
lordlings, then the wealthy guests ... then,
but much farther down, the literary men,
artists, and other small fry.</p>

<p>We French people have not the bump of
veneration very much developed, it is true;
but we have an admiration, approaching veneration,
for talent and science, and the same
Frenchman who takes no notice of a duke, will
turn to get a second look at a great literary
man or a savant. The commonplace Englishman,
who humbles himself before a village
squire, or a big banker, takes his revenge when
he meets the schoolmaster who, in France,
would be a <i>professeur</i>, but who, in England,
were he a double first of Oxford, an ex-scholar
of Balliol College, goes through life by the
name of <i>schoolmaster</i>; rinse your mouth
quickly.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>In England, social disparity excites no jealousy.
On the contrary, the noble and the
wealthy are popular.</p>

<p>In France, we have given up admitting
superiority since our walls have been ornamented
with the announcement that <i>all</i>
Frenchmen are brethren, free men, and equals.
This rage for equality degenerates into jealousy
of all superiority. In fact, the French are all
equal to their superiors, and most of them
superior to their equals. As soon as superiority
clearly manifests itself, in political life, in
literature, in the fine arts, anywhere, it is
ostracized.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>I was talking one day with a Frenchman,
who still massacres the English language,
although he has lived in this country more
than twenty years. In the course of conversation
I named a compatriot of ours. "Now,
<i>there</i> is a man," said I, "who speaks English
admirably."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>"Admirably?" cried he, "well, yes, he does
... like the rest of us."</p>

<p>This is a truly French retort.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Jealousy is the commonest and most characteristic
failing of the French.</p>

<p>With us, jealousy is not only the stamp of
mediocrity, as it is everywhere else; it is a
malady that our greatest men have been
tainted with. The acrimonious and contemptible
polemic that Bossuet and F&eacute;nelon engaged
in, the implacable hatred of Voltaire
toward Rousseau, are but two instances of it;
the history of French literature abounds with
others. Our Parisian newspapers are daily
filled with polemics and personalities.</p>

<p>In England, everyone minds his own business,
and does not trouble himself about what
his neighbor says or does.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>May I be allowed to make another comparison
here?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>If the Englishman is less jealous than the
Frenchman of the success of his fellow-creature,
it is because he often does not attribute
it to the same causes.</p>

<p>The Englishman maintains, rightly or
wrongly, that a man owes his successes far
more to his character than to his talent. If I
am not mistaken, it was Thomas Carlyle who
laid down this rule of British philosophy.</p>

<p>This philosophical proposition is very comforting
to the misunderstood; to hint to a
man that he is less talented than another, is to
vex him; on the contrary, to tell him that he
has less shrewdness, is almost to pay him a
compliment.</p>

<h3>THE FRENCH SNOB.</h3>


<p>It would be imprudent, not to say impudent,
to attack the subject of English snobs. There
are themes which seem marked "Dangerous
ground." If the French want to know all
about English snobs, they must turn to Thackeray,
who has completely exhausted the subject.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The snob is the man who is utterly destitute
of nobility. I should like to explain the word
etymologically thus: <i>Snob</i> from <i>S. Nob</i>. (<i>Sine
Nobilitate</i>).</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The snob is the man who is ashamed of his
origin, and wishes to occupy a better place in
society than he is entitled to; who hires a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 124]</span>
couple of flunkeys by the evening, to make
folks believe he keeps a grand establishment;
or who lowers his blinds from the middle of
July to the middle of September, to make it
appear that he is out of town, <i>en vill&eacute;giature</i>,
at the seaside, or at his place in the country.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The king of French snobs calls himself
M. du Bois, M. du Val, M. du Mont&mdash;or better
still, M. de la Roche-Pichenette. His father,
an honest man, and useful member of society,
amassed penny by penny a snug fortune; his
name was Dumont, Duval, Dubois, of the <i>bois</i>
of which useful men are made. The son
squanders the money of his lamented papa,
and calls himself Du Bois, of the <i>bois</i> of which
parasites and idlers are made. If one of his
estates happens to be called "la Roche-Pichenette,"
he dubs himself M. de la Roche-Pichenette,
which looks grander still. He
would be puzzled to show you the letters
patent which authorize him in assuming this<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 125]</span>
grotesque name; but he will tell you that, if
he cannot do so, it is because those Republican
scoundrels of '93 destroyed them. He is
a clerical and stanch Royalist, as a matter of
course; <i>noblesse oblige</i>. In this respect he outdoes
the genuine nobleman, who needs make
no noise to attract attention to a name which
everyone knows, and which, in spite of what
may be said on the subject, often recalls the
memory of some glorious event in the past.
Noise he must make, unfortunately for his
cause. So a German jumps on the table to
make believe that he is merry.</p>

<p>He talks of his ancestors, and rails at the
Revolution which made a man of him. Ancestors
he has, of course, as you and I have;
they were, doubtless, worthy fellows, good
patriots, who may have been present at Fontenoy,
at Rocroy, or even at the siege of Jerusalem,
for the very simple reason that the
principle of spontaneous generation has never
been applied to man. But if his ancestors lent
a helping hand at the taking of Jerusalem, and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 126]</span>
also, perhaps, by the irony of fate, at the taking
of the Bastille, he, for his part, has taken
nothing particular except a sham title.</p>

<p>This kind of snob is not met with in England.
The names of the lords, baronets, and
knights are published every year; fraud is impossible.
The few contraband barons that are
to be found in England are barons of the Holy
Empire.</p>

<h3>A SUCCESS AS AN ANGLOPHOBIST. (THE
LATE MARQUIS DE BOISSY.)</h3>


<p>The Anglophobist of the purest water that
France ever produced, was the late Marquis de
Boissy, senator of the second Empire. This
witty, eloquent, spirited old Gaul, was the soul
of the august assembly, the only member of it
who was not either stuffed or embalmed, and
his memory alone will save it from oblivion.
His philippics will long ring in the ears of the
French.</p>

<p>Whether he was in the tribune treating the
subject of home or foreign politics, or whether
he was making a speech at the agricultural
committee meeting of his borough, he had
but one peroration, his cherished device, his
hobby:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Delenda est Britannia.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 128]</span>He
used to accuse England of smothering
the human race with her breath, and would
compare her to the octopus, that hideous and
sticky mass whose tentacles have the property
of creating a vacuum around them.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>"The world will never have any peace," said
he, "until that brute has ceased sucking the
blood of other nations, and been sunk at the
bottom of the sea. Old as I am, I would go
for a drummer, so that I might lend a helping
hand in subduing the nation that has violated
the most sacred laws of humanity."</p>

<p>All the scourges that visit the earth were
put down by him to the credit of that traitress
of a neighbor; earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
inundations, cholera, the plague; even down
to his own colds in the head, all were attributed
by him to the baneful influence of the
breeze that had passed over England.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate to declare that the air of
the Champs-Elys&eacute;es in Paris was polluted by<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 129]</span>
the presence of the English colony in its midst.
Every time he passed through it, he fumigated
himself as soon as he reached home.</p>

<p>Poor Marquis de Boissy, what would you
have said, if you had lived long enough to
receive invitations to <i>five o'clocquer</i>?</p>

<p>The old Anglophobist was sincere in his epic
outbursts, and at the same time very amusing,
for he was as full of wit as he was of Anglophobia.</p>

<p>He is dead, leaving no successor; France is
at present without a declared Anglophobist.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>WOMAN WORSHIP.</h3>


<p>A worshiper of grace and beauty, the
Frenchman has given to woman a place which
she occupies in no other nation.</p>

<p>Since the days when Aspasia inspired Socrates
and advised Pericles, in no other country
has woman's sovereignty been so supreme as
it has always been, and still is, in France.</p>

<p>The Frenchman is keenly alive to woman's
influence, and woman is an ever-present, a
fixed, idea with him. Whether he study her
from the artistic, physiological, or psychological
point of view, his interest in her is never
exhausted.</p>

<p>It is a case of woman worship. Parodying
Terence's lines, he says:</p>

<p>"I am a man, and all that concerns woman
interests me."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Nothing is more absurd in the eyes of the
English than this ever-present idea of woman
in the mind of the Frenchman, and as our dear
neighbors do not know us any better than if
an ocean, instead of a silver streak, separated
us and them, they indulge in a thousand and
one commentaries upon the puerility of our
character.</p>

<p>However, it is to our education, and to that
alone, that this weak but charming side of our
national character must be attributed.</p>

<p>If, from the tenderest age, we were used to
liberty and the companionship of children of
the other sex, we should grow up thinking
very little about liberty and women, and we
should succeed in acquiring that <i>sangfroid</i>
which is the foundation-stone of the prosperity
and the greatness of the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<p>When we were schoolboys, and a rumor
spread through the class rooms that the sister
of So-and-So was in the parlor, do you remember,
my dear compatriots, what a commotion
it created throughout the whole establish<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 133]</span>ment?
Do you remember how we climbed on
tables and chairs, and how happy we were if
we could but catch sight of the corner of a
petticoat at the other end of the courtyard?
No wonder, for, to us, a girl was quite an extraordinary
being, something almost supernatural.
The scream of the young ladies of
Miss Tomkins' Seminary, on hearing that "a
man is behind the door!" is nothing, compared
to the magic cry, "<i>Une fille!</i>" in a
French school.</p>

<p>Is not the object of man's worship always
something unknown, extraordinary, ideal? Is
it not always clothed in mystery? Have we
ever bestowed unlimited admiration upon
those whose society we frequent every day?
Habit kills admiration,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as it kills all sentiments
that live upon illusions. If, from our
childhood, woman were the companion of our
daily games and walks, should we not look
upon her with different eyes?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>To us Frenchmen, woman is a being whom
we consider greatly superior to ourselves,
because we have made an ideal of her.</p>

<p>To the Englishman, woman is a creature
whom he looks down upon as a frail and frivolous
being, greatly inferior to himself. With
what an air of sovereign condescension the
English schoolboy tells his young girl friends
all about the game of football or cricket, in
which he has taken part! His manner seems
to say: "Is it not awfully kind of me to take
the trouble to enter into these details with
poor, puny creatures like you, who cannot
appreciate them?"</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>In France, whatever a woman does is right;
even her errors almost turn to her advantage.
If she breaks her marriage vows, it is not she
who is covered with shame, it is her husband
who is covered with ridicule; and people immediately
look for defects in him, and excuses
for her.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>A society thus governed by women may
lack firmness, but its salient points are sure to
be good taste, delicacy, tact, wit, and amiability.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to mention here the
ascendancy which women took over French
literature in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, and during the early part of the
present one, through the influence of the <i>salons
litt&eacute;raires</i>. Does it not seem, in fact, as if the
history of French literature might be summed
up by naming the H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet, and
the <i>salons</i> of Mme. des Loges, Mlle. de Scud&eacute;ry,
Mme. de Sabl&eacute;, Ninon de Lenclos, Mme.
Scarron, the Duchesse du Maine, the Marquise
de Lambert, Mme. du Deffand, Mme. d'Epinay,
Mme. de Caylus, Mme. de Vintimille, Mme.
R&eacute;camier, Mme. de Sta&euml;l, and Mme. Girardin?
Do we not know the courts of Louis XIV.,
Louis XV., Louis XVI., and Napoleon I. by
the letters and memoirs of this splendid legion
of women belonging to "<i>la soci&eacute;t&eacute; polie</i>" who
have taught us the art of <i>causer</i>, that art of
which we French have the monopoly?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>This woman worship, from which chivalry
sprang, is the source of another trait characteristic
of the French nation, a trait which we
have a right to be proud of. I speak of our
respect for the weak. I engage that the lowest
quarter of any French town would be
roused into revolution at the sound of a man
having ill-treated a woman or child. It is a
sentiment innate in the Celt, and which would
be found in the Englishman, if the Germanic
element had not gained the ascendancy in
England.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Is there any prettier sight than that of our
public gardens filled with well-dressed, bright-faced
young mothers, whose husbands come,
when business is over, to listen to the band at
their side, and to take them to their homes,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 137]</span>
from which care is banished as far as possible,
and where they are made sharers in each joy
of their husbands?</p>

<p>Can we imagine a pleasure party of any kind
without the presence of women? And when I
say <i>we</i>, I mean all classes of society. When
our workman sets out, on Sunday mornings,
for the Jardin de la Muette or the Bois de
Meudon, with provisions for the day, he takes
his wife and children with him; and even his
old mother, if he have one, must go too, or the
party is not complete.</p>

<p>I confess that those world-famed English
dinners which are not brightened by the presence
of ladies have but little charm for me.</p>

<p>"Those English people enjoy themselves
as we bore ourselves to death," once said
Mme. Vig&eacute;e-Lebrun.</p>

<p>When I say that women are rarely seen at
the great public dinners, which are the distinguishing
feature of English society, I exaggerate.
They are sometimes admitted ... to
the galleries, from thence to contemplate the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 138]</span>
lords of creation consuming their prodigious
repast.</p>

<p>Gallantry could surely go no further.</p>

<p>Looking from the gallant knights of the
trencher to the pretty faces in the gallery, I
have more than once exclaimed to myself:
"Nobody can say that an Englishman's eyes
are bigger than his stomach."</p>

<h3>FAITH AND REASON.</h3>


<p>The various religions in existence were
founded by men of different nations to suit
their own character.</p>

<p>The French, impressionable and fond of
pompous pageants, adopted a mystical religion,
which addresses itself to their senses; the
English, cool and argumentative, preferred a
religion which addresses itself to their reason.
This is why churches in France savor of the
theater, and churches in England savor of the
lecture-room.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Calvinism did not take root in France, and
never will, because it is not amiable. Romanism
will never flourish in England again,
because it says: "Believe, without seeking to
understand."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>The Roman Catholic religion aims at gaining
a hold over the heart, the Protestant religion
aims at gaining a hold over the mind.
The first attracts women by its poetry and
mysticism and governs through them; the
second attracts men by sometimes offering
them food for their intellectual appetites.</p>

<p>Finally, the first is under the control of a
foreign power, the second is national.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>We French people worship a tender, merciful,
almost familiar, God, whom we are wont
to call <i>sweet</i> Savior.</p>

<p>The English worship the God of the Jews,
that God Who commanded His chosen people
to exterminate their enemies, and spare neither
man, woman, or child, and Whom they call
<i>awful</i> God.</p>

<p>The manner in which we speak of the Divinity
shocks the English; the manner in which
the English worship Him leaves us cold and
indifferent.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>To the Frenchmen who say that religion
is incompatible with liberty, I would simply
reply: England and America are the freest
nations in the world, and at the same time the
most religious&mdash;I mean the most church-going.</p>

<p>To the English who say that there is no
religion in France, I would reply: Our
churches are not, like yours, full only from
eleven to half-past twelve; they are thronged
from six o'clock in the morning to one in the
afternoon by a crowd whose fervor is second
to that of no other church-goers, and this
French piety is all the more admirable because,
in our country, religion is not an indispensable
garment, as it is in England.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>It would be as imprudent to judge the religion
of the English from the French point of
view, as it would be to judge the religion of
the French from the English point of view.
This being granted, something more is requisite,
if we would judge fairly, and that is to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 142]</span>
start with the principle that all convictions
that are dictated by conscience are worthy of
respect.</p>

<p>But such is not the usual manner of setting
about it. To call one's neighbors "idolaters,"
and hear one's self called "marchand de Bible"
in return, is certainly much more lively.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The English have given the name of Mariolatry
to the homage paid to the Mother of
Christ, and it is a deep-rooted belief in England
that the French pay to Mary a worship
equal to that which they pay to God.</p>

<p>Like ourselves, they too often judge by appearances.</p>

<p>The divine honors paid to the Virgin Mary
have nothing to do with adoration; the prayers
addressed to her are for intercession. It is
a poetical homage rendered chiefly by women,
who would fain have the holiest of women
plead with a beloved son on their behalf. It
is to her that the young girl turns who has<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 143]</span>
just engaged her heart; it is to her that the
young mother prays as she bends over the
cradle of her child.</p>

<p>"Horrible!" cry the Protestants, "as if God
were not just, as if He wanted to be told what
He should do!"</p>

<p>But since you pray to Him yourselves, it is
clear that you think it advisable to remind
Him sometimes of your needs.</p>

<p>Then the Frenchman (excuse a comparison
which, to my mind, appears to be strikingly
true), the Frenchman, I say, who has the love
and respect for his mother inborn in him, cannot
help believing that God could not find it
in His heart to refuse him anything, if Mary,
His mother, would only undertake to intercede
on his behalf.</p>

<p>The homage paid to the Virgin is nothing
short of a worship to Purity, and the most
ignorant Irish peasant girl has the conscience
of her value when she feels she can kneel down
before the white-robed statue. The influence
of this worship on morality is enormous.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>Take figures.</p>

<p>In Scotland, the proportion of illegitimate
children is 16 per cent. In Protestant Ireland
(County of Antrim, etc.) it is 7 per cent. In
the poorest parts of Roman Catholic Ireland,
the proportion is only &frac12; per cent.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>A religion is materialized that is practiced in
temples adorned with statues and pictures,
images of the dwellers in the realms of the
blest. The uncultured mortal does not know
what abstraction is. He believes in what he
sees. When our peasant folk think of God,
they picture Him to themselves as an august
personage in a blue robe with flowing sleeves,
who keeps the accounts of our good and bad
actions and receives in private audience every
morning certain saints, dressed in various colors
(St. Peter invariably in bottle-green), who
come to talk of their <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>, and recommend
them to His mercy.</p>

<p>This materialism of the other world helps<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 145]</span>
the ignorant to understand, and explains why
the poor crowd our churches, in the provinces
at all events. I say <i>in the provinces</i> especially,
for it would be as wrong to judge France by
Paris, as it would be to judge England by
Regent Street and the Haymarket. This is a
remark that I should like to repeat at every page.</p>

<p>"What is it that these English people worship?"
is the question invariably asked by the
French who visit English churches and chapels.
The fact is, there is nothing to be seen
there but whitewashed walls, benches, an
organ, and an enormous Bible. Tell them
that, in the eyes of the English, a crucifix is a
profane object, that would be looked upon
with as much horror as a statue of Vishnu, and
they will have their doubts whether the name
of Christian really ought to be applied to an
English person.</p>

<p>In religion, everything is spiritualized in
England and America. A crucifix recalls the
fact that Christ became man.</p>

<p>The English will have neither crucifix,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 146]</span>
statue, nor picture in their churches, because
they adhere to the Bible, and there they find,
among the commandments of God, given on
Mount Sinai:</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven
image, or any likeness of anything that is in
the heaven. Thou shalt not bow down to
them, nor worship them."</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church has suppressed
this commandment. It is not for me to criticise
her; but as she has adopted a certain
number of commandments, which she has even
translated into verse in order to fix them more
easily in the minds of the faithful, she would
have perhaps done better to adopt them all.
At any rate she has done wisely in interdicting
discussion among her followers, and in telling
them:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Ce que je dis tu croiras<br />
Sans raisonner auparavant.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The Protestant religion is more practical
and better adapted to modern life than the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 147]</span>
Catholic one; but if the Protestant faith may
help you to live, I believe the Catholic faith
may better help you to die.</p>

<p><br />Whereas the materialization practiced by
the Roman Church attracts the lower classes,
the spiritualization of the Anglican Church
tends to estrange them. The great unwashed
of England would not understand the service
of the Anglican Church. This is partly why
cornets and drums are being resorted to, to
draw them out of their slums.</p>

<p>Everyone takes his religion where he finds it.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Does not the frequentation of French cemeteries
show how attached we are to the body?
Does not the solitude of English cemeteries
show how little our neighbors share this feeling?</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The Catholic is no theologian. He does not
discuss the sermons that are preached to him;<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 148]</span>
he may criticise the language of the preacher,
but dogma is not in his line. All that is
spoken from the pulpit is gospel to him.</p>

<p>The Protestant is essentially a theologian.
He sifts most carefully all that he hears in
church. He is not of opinion that man was
made for religion, but that religion was made
for man. I have seen more than one storm in
a teacup aroused, in little country towns, by a
certain sermon that had appeared to the congregation
to be unorthodox. The local newspapers
would be full of letters containing the
bitterest and most violent recriminations.
The clergyman, attacked like a mere politician
who had changed his colors, would defend
himself by writing letter after letter to the
paper. Bible in hand, he refuted the arguments
of his adversaries, who were his own
flock, be it understood.</p>

<p>No demi-gods in England; everyone has to
pass through the Caudine Forks of criticism.</p>

<p>A young country curate, finding that his<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 149]</span>
tradesmen's bills were taking larger proportions
than his modest income could stand,
resolved one day to thunder from the pulpit
against the thirst for riches.</p>

<p>He prepared his thunderbolts.</p>

<p>Never did Horace or Bourdaloue utter such
anathemas against the vices of the day.</p>

<p>"My dear brethren," he cried, "is it possible
that you can thus place the love of filthy lucre
above the love of virtue?"</p>

<p>And, after a few generalities, he came
straight to the point; he accused the tradesmen
of making too large profits, and of caring
more for the things of this world than for the
things of the next.</p>

<p>A few days later, it being the 5th of November,
the curate was burnt in effigy.</p>

<p>His parishioners having rendered his life not
worth living in the pretty little town of X&mdash;&mdash;,
the young reverend gentleman lost no time in
packing up his traps and quitting the neighborhood,
with the firm resolution never to
preach any more sermons <i>ad hominem</i>.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>The Anglican, or State Church of England
is a Tory institution, that is to say, an eminently
Conservative one. It is also a great
school of discipline for the people. As an
Englishman of much good sense said to me
one day, the clergyman of a small town advantageously
replaces half a dozen policemen.</p>

<p>The Anglican Church is the Church of English
good society.</p>

<p>In my quality of Frenchman, I confess to
having a partiality for this church, and of
dreading the time when she will be separated
from the state.</p>

<p>This is why.</p>

<p>If we have many sympathizers in England,
they must not be looked for, as a rule, among
the bigots of all the little conventicles, who
vie with one another in presenting the most
striking appearance of virtue and piety.</p>

<p>By these pretentious, narrow-minded folk,
the French are more or less looked upon as
children of the Evil One. The intelligent
Englishmen of good society, who know and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 151]</span>
often admire us, generally belong to the Anglican
Church, which takes care of their future
"by special appointment," and allows them to
relax a little from their natural austerity.</p>

<p>Nature has made the Englishman a Puritan.
Churchman or not, stir him up, and it is the
Puritan which rises to the surface. The day
on which the Church of England is disestablished,
England will be all Puritan.</p>

<h3>THE WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF.</h3>


<p>Nothing is done for mere glory in England,
every undertaking has a practical aim.</p>

<p>In France, every intelligent boy of the middle
class goes through his classical studies;
even though he may only be intended for a
commercial career, his father makes him try to
pass his B. A. or B. Sc. In England, boys
learn Latin and Greek in order to pass examinations,
which lead to certain positions.
With us, education is an indispensable ornament;
here, it is a means to an end. Thus,
though primary education may be much more
widely spread in England, higher education is
much more widely spread in France.</p>

<p>It is at school that young England begins to
learn to make genuflections before the Golden
Calf. The best prizes awarded in the large<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 154]</span>
public schools are prizes of money. These
establishments grant exhibitions of from &pound;40
to &pound;100 a year, during four or five years, to
the best of the pupils who leave them to go to
the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge.</p>

<p>This scholarship system would be admirable
if its object was to help the sons of poor<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> parents
to continue their studies at the Universities;
but such is not the case; these scholarships
are constantly awarded, either through
competitive examination, or through the personal
interest of a governor, to sons of rich
parents. And yet, these scholarships were
founded by charitable persons, who bequeathed
money to be applied to the education of the
intelligent sons of poor parents. At present,
the scholarships of the great schools of the
City are at the disposal of the City Companies,
who have monopolized them for their families
and friends, for charity is organized on an im<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 155]</span>mense
scale in England, especially that well-ordered
kind which begins at home.</p>

<p>The consequence of this state of things is
that John Bull, that unsurpassed payer of
taxes, is obliged to keep up Board schools in
London at an enormous expense. If the great
City schools fulfilled the purpose for which
they were established by their "pious founders,"
school rates would be reduced by one-half.</p>

<p>"No money, no Englishman."</p>

<p>The Royal Academy is closed on Sundays;
no free day.</p>

<p>The now annual exhibitions at South Kensington
are closed on Sundays. No free entry
during the week.</p>

<p>The Zo&ouml;logical Gardens are, as a matter of
fact, open free on Sundays ... but only for
the well-to-do classes, who may obtain special
orders from the Fellows of the Zo&ouml;logical
Society.</p>

<p>All the museums are closed on Sundays.</p>

<p>There is no place for the poor at the ban<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 156]</span>quet
of life in England. For them, beer and
Bible, only.</p>

<p>They take beer.</p>

<p>Not even at church is there room for them;
for I maintain that the man or woman whose
clothes were not what is called here <i>decent</i>,
would be turned away from the door; what
the pastors want are sheep who will take a
pew by the year, and put silver pieces on the
plate.</p>

<p>And people marvel, or rather lament, that
the workman, who has worked all the week,
and has no home fit to spend his Sunday in,
spends it at the public house.</p>

<p>But where is he to go? The English, who
are generally so sensible, are curiously inconsistent
in this matter.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>I have seen, in English illustrated papers,
pictures of Sunday in London and Sunday in
Paris. The first represented a dirty mob of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 157]</span>
men and women, drinking, quarreling, and
fighting; the second, groups of workmen,
accompanied by their wives, their children,
and their old parents, in contemplation before
the pictures in the Louvre Museum.</p>

<p>This was doing us justice for once.</p>

<p>Intelligent and liberal England is moving
heaven and earth to get the museums thrown
open to the people on Sundays. The Prince
of Wales, and the leaders of all the aristocracies
of the country, are at the head of the
movement; but all the little narrow-minded
and bigoted world is leagued against them,
and it is not probable that they will succeed.
Meanwhile, the London taverns remain open,
which proves that the English bigots consider
gin and beer more powerful moral stimulants
than the masterpieces of great artists; such
appears also to be the decided opinion of the
bishops, who never fail to attend at the House
of Lords in full force when the subject is coming
on for discussion.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>England erects her statues to the nobility
and to finance. You see, England's great literary
men were so numerous, that they had
to be relegated to a corner of Westminster
Abbey, for fear they should hinder circulation
in the streets. With the aid of a guidebook,
you may succeed in discovering the tablets
erected to their memory by a not too grateful
country.</p>

<p>Thackeray, the immortal author of "Vanity
Fair," is rewarded with a tablet about
a foot square. But, then, if you will take a
walk around the Stock Exchange, you will see
the third statue of the Duke of Wellington,
and one of Peabody, the millionaire. In a
little narrow City street, a bust of Milton, in
an obscure niche, reminds the passer-by that
the author of "Paradise Lost" was born in
that place. It is comparatively unnoticed.
In the wild, headlong, guinea chase, there is
no time for trifling! Paris has a <i>Rue Milton</i>
to make up for it.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Yet this thirst for gold has been the greatest
civilizing power of modern times. It is this
which has opened up new markets for commerce
in the remotest corners of the world.
This British Empire, which has been called a
brazen colossus with feet of clay, is the greatest
empire it was ever given to man to found.</p>

<p>In a hundred years' time, Australia will
probably be a strong and independent Republic,
a second America; but the separation will
mean no loss of prestige or of profit to England;
her commerce will not suffer; her steamboats
will continue to ply between London
and Sydney, as they do between Liverpool
and New York.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Who would dare to compare the greater
number of England's conquests to those sterile
ones that only survive in man's memory by
the tears and blood that they have caused to
flow?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>"We are a wonderful people," cries General
Gordon, in his <i>Diary at Khartoum</i>; "it was
never our Government which made us a great
nation; our Government has ever been the
drag on our wheels. England was made by
adventurers, not by her Government; and I
believe she will only hold her place by adventurers."</p>

<p>This is true enough.</p>

<p>They were adventurers, who were the first
to set foot on the soil of those remote regions
which have been added one by one to the lists
of England's colonies; but if England is a
great nation, it is thanks to heroic deeds, such
as thine, great advanced sentinel of modern
civilization, who for months couldst unaided
keep hordes of barbarians in check; it is
thanks to heroes of thy stamp, poor Gordon!</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>England conquers by the railway. She imposes
her civilization and her commerce in the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 161]</span>
countries she subdues, puts the natives in the
way of earning money, and sensibly takes care
to make her yoke felt as little as possible.
Her commercial power makes her indispensable
to the rest of the world, including the
shareholders of the Suez Canal Company, to
whom she pays more than three times as much
as all the other powers put together.</p>

<p>That which makes the strength of this colonial
empire, is that each colony, like each child
in the mother-country, serves the apprenticeship
of life in the enjoyment of liberty.</p>

<p>As each colony becomes rich enough to
suffice unto itself, and strong enough to defend
itself, England says to the colonists: "You are
now big enough to manage for yourselves, it
is time you learnt to do without my help."
This is what the Englishman says to his sons,
as they come to man's estate. The colony
forms its government, chooses its ministers,
and its parliament; sends representatives to
England to watch over its interests there, and
becomes, as it were, a branch house of that<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 162]</span>
immense firm, known in every latitude, under
the name of "John Bull and Company."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>All forms of worship will lend themselves to
exaggeration and develop eccentricities, and
most certainly it is not the worship of the
Golden Calf that is an exception to the rule.
Let us look at the question from this side as
well as the other.</p>

<p>You never run the risk of offending an
Englishman by offering him money.</p>

<p>Everyone must remember the lamentations
of the Madagascar missionary, Mr. Shaw.
The reverend gentleman had been parted from
his flock, and obliged to take pot-luck on
board the late Admiral Pierre's vessel. What
meant those jeremiads? Was it apologies
he wanted? Not a bit of it! This apostle
wanted cash. From the day that he received
$5000 from the French Government not a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 163]</span>
word more was heard from him. He was
quiet and happy.</p>

<p>$5000 for having eaten a few bad dinners!
It does not fall to everyone's share to dine so
satisfactorily as that.</p>

<p>Although the labor of preparing the posthumous
works of Victor Hugo for publication
will be enormous, his literary executors have
refused to accept the profits, sure to be immense,
which the poet meant should be the
reward of their arduous task. But the thought
of receiving money for such a labor of love is
odious to them. English people may look
upon this as sentimentality, but it compares
very favorably with the highly practical proceedings
of Thomas Carlyle's literary executor.</p>

<p>M. H&mdash;&mdash;, the French <i>d&eacute;put&eacute;</i>, who obtained
10,000 francs damages the other day, in Paris,
from an individual who had insulted his wife,
gave the money to the poor the very same
day. It is a fact that, in France, no man, jealous
of his honor, would pocket such gains.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>"But," you will say, "surely the Reverend
Mr. Shaw gave his $5000 to the poor, or to
some good cause&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>You little know the type.</p>

<p>In England, it is only too much the fashion
to carry everything to the bank&mdash;an insult, a
kick, the loss of a lover, the faithlessness of a
wife, all possible inconveniences; the almighty
guinea consoles for every wrong, and may be
offered to anyone.</p>

<p>On his wedding day (January 28, 1885), the
Rev. Stephen Gladstone, Vicar of Hawarden,
and son of the Prime Minister of England,
received, among his numerous wedding presents,
a check for a hundred pounds from Dr.
Sir Andrew Clark, and another for the same
sum from the Duke of Westminster. The
thing was so natural that not a single English
paper commented on the fact.</p>

<p>In France, such a wedding present could
only be offered to a domestic who had served
us faithfully for some time.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>I was in France, spending a few days with a
farmer in the heart of the country.</p>

<p>Dressed in a blouse and a large straw hat, I
was one day taking a walk on the main road,
when an Englishman, accompanied by a young
lad of fifteen, accosted me, and asked which
was the shortest way to the village of M&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Delighted to see an Englishman, I volunteered
all the information that was at my command.
I even offered to accompany him as
far as the lane which led to M&mdash;&mdash;, and he
willingly accepted.</p>

<p>After racking my brains to give my Englishman
every detail I could think of, concerning
the interesting village he was about to visit, I
proposed to turn back.</p>

<p>He, after having uttered a formidable "Aoh"
for all thanks, went on his way.</p>

<p>I had spoken in French. I always like to
make Englishmen speak French when I meet
them in France. It is my little revenge.</p>

<p>I will admit that, in my rustic attire, I could<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 166]</span>
not have looked much of a dandy; but, in
France, we have still preserved that good old
habit of saying "Thank you," even to our inferiors.</p>

<p>The Briton had simply treated me as he
would have a City policeman who had told
him his way.</p>

<p>I called him back.</p>

<p>"<i>Excusez-moi</i>," I said.</p>

<p>"<i>Aoh! mon ami, oui ... je sav&eacute; ce que vo&mdash;vol&eacute;
... je demand&eacute; pardonne.</i>"</p>

<p>And, without another word, he drew from
his pocket a fifty-centime piece, which he
slipped into my hand.</p>

<p>As you must always keep what an Englishman
gives you a chance of pocketing, I did
not hesitate to put the fifty-centimes in a safe
place.</p>

<p>This done, I said to him in decent English:</p>

<p>"My dear sir, let me give you a piece of advice.
When you have got a Frenchman to
talk himself hoarse to explain to you your way,
just thank him."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>"Why, sir, you speak English&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was immediately all apologies.</p>

<p>"Above all," I continued, "never offer
money in this country before you are quite
sure it will be acceptable. You might have it
thrown in your face," I added laughing.</p>

<p>My Englishman held out his hand, as if to
receive back his fifty centimes.</p>

<p>"Oh! with me," I said to him, "there is no
danger. I have lived a long while in England,
and I am pretty businesslike by this time. I
never throw money out of windows or in people's
faces ... I put it in my pocket."</p>

<p>My practical ideas won me his esteem. We
laughed heartily over the adventure, and
parted the best of friends.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>After having beaten the Ashantees, in 1874,
brought home the umbrella of their king, and
burnt their capital, a feat not requiring much
talent, the dwellings being built of wood and
straw, General Wolseley, on his return to Eng<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 168]</span>land,
had a grant of &pound;25,000 made to him.
Eight years later, on his return from Egypt,
this same general received a peerage and
&pound;28,000. Lord Alcester, his companion in
arms, who had operated on the walls of Alexandria,
while he was operating on the backs of
the Egyptians, also obtained a peerage and
&pound;30,000. When I consider that, during the
siege of Alexandria, the English had only
three men put <i>hors de combat</i>, it occurs to me
that doubtless these rewards were granted to
Lord Alcester at the suggestion of the British
Royal Humane Society.</p>

<p>And yet General Roberts, the history of
whose celebrated march to Candahar will remain
written in letters of gold among the
records of the great military feats of the present
century, had to content himself with the
Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.</p>

<p>General Wolseley, now Baron of Cairo, a
name so grotesque that he has never yet cared
to assume it in public, was one day sent back
to the Soudan to deliver Gordon, that modern<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 169]</span>
<i>chevalier sans peur et sans reproche</i>. The perspective
was tempting; there was every prospect
of an ample harvest of honors and
banknotes. Unfortunately, the Mahdi cut
the grass under the general's feet, and he
arrived too late. Poor Gordon had to die,
not to save his country, but to become, and
forever remain, a specter at England's feast,
the victim of her vacillations, a standing reproach
to her indifference.</p>

<p>Gordon and Wolseley! to think that, by the
irony of fate, these two names should have
been associated in the same campaign! The
soldier saint, and the noble millionaire, whose
victories are sounded with the clink of guineas.</p>

<p>"Look, here, upon this picture, and on this."</p>

<p>And you, O heroes of antiquity, arise from
your long sleep, and see the progress that military
art has made! Veil your faces, O Fabricius,
Cincinnatus, and all you Romans, who,
after you had subdued your country's foes,
and drawn fettered kings behind your triumphal
chariots, returned to cultivate your fields,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 170]</span>
and died so poor that you had to be buried at
the public expense.</p>


<p><br />It has long been England's practice to reward
with money those who had rendered
services to the country.</p>

<p>After the battle of Waterloo, the Duke of
Wellington received, as a present from the
nation, &pound;400,000 and a palace at the entrance
of Hyde Park.</p>

<p>With reference to the grants to the famous
Duke of Marlborough, that great general, who
filled the hearts of his enemies with terror, and
the pockets of his family with the money of
his countrymen, and whose descendants still
receive from the state the sum of &pound;4000 a
year, Swift compares, in the <i>Examiner</i>, the generosity
of the Romans with the generosity of
the English:</p>

<h3>WHY THE FRENCH WERE BEATEN IN 1870.</h3>


<p>Everyone accounted for our disasters of 1870
after his own fashion. The most ingenious
theories were brought forward, and we very
well know why we believe it to be indispensable
and patriotic to learn German.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried some, "if we had only known
German, we should not have been defeated."
And forthwith instruction in German was
decreed obligatory.</p>

<p>"That is not it," said others, "it is our geography,
of which we did not know even the
rudiments, that has been the cause of all the
evil. On leaving Paris, our officers, ignorant of
the meanders of the Seine, thought that they
were beating a retreat each time they came to
a fresh bend of that river." And the study of
geography received a fillip.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>Others again would have it to be that if the
visors of our soldier's <i>k&eacute;pis</i> had not been lifted
upward in front, the Prussians would have had
a warm time of it. Down came the visors
without delay.</p>

<p>I pass over the pious people, who saw in our
disasters only the just chastisement of our
faults, and will only give the opinion of
Thomas Carlyle. This philosopher, whom the
hazard of birth had made English, but who
was a perfect German, cried out that "Germanic
virtues had triumphed over Gallic
vices."</p>

<p>Some few worthy folks, perfectly destitute
of genius, but possessing an ounce or two of
common sense, attributed our defeats to the
fact that the Germans had an army of 1,200,000
men, whereas our own forces scarcely numbered
350,000. I fancy it is these latter that
history will show to have been in the right.</p>

<p>The virtuous Germans that vanquished us,
were they, after all, so clever at geography and
French? This is how they learnt the geogra<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 175]</span>phy
they required, and how they made themselves
understood in French:</p>

<p>A few Uhlans would approach to within a
respectful distance of a village. There they
would seize upon the first peasant, old man, or
child, that passed, place a pistol to his throat,
and after asking, "Are there any French soldiers
in your village?" would say: "Show us
the way to such and such place, and tell us the
names of all the people around here, who have
wine in their cellars, or hay in their barns.
And you had better take care to tell the
truth, or we will blow your brains out, and set
fire to the four corners of your village."</p>

<p>Loaded pistols and lighted torches are magical
quickeners of slow intellects; a deaf man
would understand such arguments as these.
If I took by the collar the first lad I came
across in Germany, and, lifting my stick to his
head, shouted into his ear: "You young rascal,
I will knock your head off," I will warrant
he would understand me as quickly as if I
spoke the purest German.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>If we have any spare time, let us learn German
that we may be able to read Goethe and
Schiller; from the practical point of view, the
utility of German is but secondary. If we
should ever demand of Germany the provinces
that she wrenched from us, we shall find we
have enough German-speaking mouths, if we
can only put into the field as many mouths of
cannon as Wilhem II.</p>

<h3>ENGLAND WORKS FOR HERSELF.  THE
WORLD OWES HER NOTHING.</h3>


<p>"If," as M. R&eacute;nan says,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "those nations which
have an exceptional fact in their history
expiate this fact by long sufferings and pay
for it with their national existence&mdash;if the
nations that have created unique things by
which the world profits often die victims of
their achievements," England may hope to
live a considerable time yet, for everything
that she undertakes is national, never universal.
She works for herself and herself alone.
Whenever she is asked to co-operate in the
execution of a great project of universal interest,
she refuses pointblank, unless it appears
quite clear to her that she alone will reap the
profits and honors of the undertaking. An<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 178]</span>
Englishman's sphere of action is always England
and her colonies; his only aim, British
interests&mdash;two magic words to his ears.</p>

<p>If the Channel Tunnel could be made so
that it could only be used by the English, it
would be commenced to-morrow.</p>

<p>Lord Beaconsfield pronounced patriotism to
be the most rational form of egotism. Would to
Heaven it might be so interpreted in France!</p>

<p>When shall we, in France, cease to strive
after the extraordinary and the universal?
When shall we cease to concern ourselves
about the happiness of the whole human race
and, minding our own business, undertake only
the possible and the practical? When shall we
cease to become inventors and be men of
business?</p>

<p>There is not much discovered in England
nowadays, except new ways of dodging the
arch-enemy.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Yet it was Newton who discovered the infinitesimal
calculus and the laws of universal<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 179]</span>
gravitation. Yet it was England that produced
Shakespeare, the sublimest example of
the Creator's handiwork. Yet it was Harvey
who discovered the circulation of the blood.
But now England is entirely given over to
business; she has no time to throw away upon
inventions.</p>

<p>For that matter, why should England go in
for inventing? She has money and a genius
for commerce, and, possessing these, can do
without inventors, who, as a rule, die in the
workhouse, with the satisfaction of knowing
that shrewd men of business have made fortunes
out of their discoveries.</p>

<p>This has always been so. Even the sublime
and Divine Thinker expiated with an ignominious
death the invention of a theory which, but
for the meddling of speculators, would have
insured the happiness of the world. To-day
He can contemplate from His celestial throne,
the bishops coming out of their palaces in
luxurious carriages to go to the House of
Lords and vote against the opening of muse<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 180]</span>ums
on Sundays, or on their way to the Mansion
House to feast with the Lord Mayor, who
gives better dinners than were to be had in
Galilee, I assure you.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The world is made up of fools and knaves,
such was the judgment passed upon mankind
by Thomas Carlyle, the great English historian,
a rough and dyspeptic philosopher, who
himself, however, was neither a knave nor a
fool.</p>

<p>This writer, who passed his life in insulting
his countrymen one after another, who
could make love to his wife by correspondence
when she was far away, but who never found
an amiable word to say to her when she was
near, this same Thomas Carlyle has calumniated
the world. Where should we be without
the few disinterested heroes who have devoted
themselves to the amelioration of their fellow-creatures,
and who, in return, have received<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 181]</span>
but poverty and prison, torture and death?
The men who have suffered for country,
religion, science, liberty; are these Carlyle's
fools?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>THE SPIRIT OF DESTRUCTION  AND THE
SPIRIT OF CONSERVATISM.</h3>


<p>How is it that the French are such vandals
with regard to their country and their institutions,
seeing that the love for their family,
respect for their parents, and veneration for
souvenirs, are such marked features in their
character? The fact is that France is towed
unresistingly by Paris, and that we often have
to say "the French," when in reality we only
mean "the Parisians."</p>

<p>We are accused of no longer having much
respect for anything. Alas! that it should be
impossible to deny such an accusation!</p>

<p>A country, just like a family, lives by its
traditions, its souvenirs, even by its prejudices.
Destroy these souvenirs, some of which serve
as examples and others as warnings, destroy<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 184]</span>
these traditions, and you break the chain
that binds the family together, and the past,
though never so glorious, has been lived in
vain. Is a country less dear to her sons because
of her prejudices? Do we not love to
find them in a dear old mother?</p>

<p>Do not the very prejudices and weaknesses,
the thousand little failings of our friends, often
endear them to us?</p>

<p>Then why are we not content with France
as she is? Why be always wanting to change
her? Is it possible that we Frenchmen, the
most home-abiding men in the world, can be
attacked by this ridiculous mania for change?</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The study of the French language furnishes
of itself plain proof of our spirit of destruction,
and the <i>Dictionnaire des Significations</i>, which,
is shortly to be published, and is awaited with
impatience by the learned world, will show, by
the history of the changes of meaning that our
words have undergone, that the character of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 185]</span>
the French people can be recognized to this
very day by the descriptions that were given
of it two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>The French word <i>ben&icirc;t</i> formerly meant
"blessed."</p>

<p>Thanks to the jokes of the old Gauls, our
ancestors, it now means "silly." Our forefathers
heard in church: "Benedicti stulti quia
habebunt regnum c&#339;lorum."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> B&eacute;nis seront
les pauvres d'esprit, car ils auront le royaume
des cieux. Now, in French, <i>pauvre d'esprit</i>
means "silly," and, on their way home, the old
jokers would indulge in merry remarks at one
another's expense. When anyone gave proof
of want of wit, he was congratulated on having
his entry into the kingdom of heaven secured:</p>

<p>"You are <i>stultus</i> enough to be <i>benedictus</i>";
and the first adjective soon came to have the
meaning of the second.</p>

<p>It will soon be impossible to pronounce the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 186]</span>
word <i>fille</i> in good society, except to express
relationship.</p>

<p>Why are we obliged to make use of this
word to designate a child of the feminine sex?
Simply because the feminine of <i>gar&ccedil;on</i> began
to be used in a bad sense in the seventeenth
century. Before the feminine of <i>gar&ccedil;on</i>&mdash;which
the French had to give up, as they will
soon have to give up the word <i>fille</i>&mdash;they had
a word which is, in the present day, a horribly
coarse expression.</p>

<p>Such is the march of the spirit of destruction.</p>

<p>The Gauls have always been rich in wit, but
wit often of a bantering and sarcastic kind,
which disparages and covers with ridicule, and
of which Voltaire was the personification.</p>

<p>People who eat sausages on a Friday,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in
France, think they are doing a smart thing,
and rebelling against a form of tyranny, forget<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 187]</span>ting
that Lenten fasts had originally a sanitary
reason. To give rest to the stomach, such was
the aim; and a French physician said to me
one day: "If there were no Lent in the spring,
I should order my patients to fast two or three
times a week, through that season of the year."</p>

<p>The Talmud forbids the Jews to eat pork,
because that meat is heavy and indigestible;
the Koran forbids the use of wine among the
Mussulmans, because of its intoxicating properties;
in fact, have not all these religious
edicts a foundation of common sense, and do
we not give proof of common sense in conforming
to them? Truly, he is but a pitiful
hero&mdash;not to use a stronger term&mdash;who boasts
of not following a salutary counsel, that he
does not know how to appreciate, because he
does not understand.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>The English, unlike us, cling to their past,
and because a custom is old, that is a sufficient
reason, in their eyes, for holding it sacred. I<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 188]</span>
feel sure that there is not an Englishman, who
does not religiously eat his slice of plum
pudding on Christmas Day, let him be in the
Bush, at the Antipodes, on land or on water,
and no matter in what latitude.</p>

<p>It is a veritable communion.</p>

<p>The English observance of the Sunday is
tyrannical, I admit, but it is an ancient institution,
and, if kept in an intelligent way, should
command respect.</p>

<p>If the people of Great Britain do not build
anything in a day, they have, at any rate, the
good habit of not demolishing anything in a
day.</p>

<p>The Englishman has an innate love of old
walls that recall to him a historical fact, a departed
grandeur, a memory of his childhood.</p>

<p>I have been present at many a touching
scene, that has proved to me how deeply the
<i>religio loci</i> is rooted in the heart of every true-born
Englishman.</p>

<p>Here is one.</p>

<p>An old City School, dating from the fifteenth<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 189]</span>
century, had just been transplanted into one of
the suburbs of London.</p>

<p>The new building is a palace compared with
the old.</p>

<p>Yet it was with profound sadness that old
scholars learnt of the removal of the school
from its time-honored home. If they could
have had a voice in the matter, the change
would not have taken place. The splendor of
the new school was nothing to them; the
name was the same, but it was their old school
no more. On the day of the farewell ceremony
in the City, I saw gray-headed men,
who had come from distant parts of the country,
on purpose to bid farewell to the venerable
walls, to have one more look at them.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>If England, who only dates from the
eleventh century, lives on her souvenirs and
turns to them for inspiration, with what souvenirs
might we inspire ourselves&mdash;we who have
been a nation for twenty-three centuries?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>There was no England when we were the
terror of Rome. There was no England when
our brave and generous ancestors went to battle
to deliver or avenge an oppressed nation,
or welcomed a poor stranger as a friend sent
by the gods. There was no England when
Vercingetorix made C&aelig;sar tremble, nor was
there yet an England when, eight hundred
years later, the exploits of Roland were inspiring
the poets of the whole of old Europe.</p>

<p>Ah! let us cling to our past, we who have
such a glorious one! Where is the nation that
can boast such another?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>ORDER AND LIBERTY.</h3>


<p>Obedience is the watchword of England.</p>

<p>The Englishman revolts only against injustice,
and that but figuratively. Brought up to
respect the law, it is in the name of the law
that he demands redress for his grievances,
and by the law that he obtains it.</p>

<p><i>Dieu et mon droit</i>, such is his device; notwithstanding
that he has rather monopolized
the first, and that his definition of the second
is a trifle vague, it is certain that by them he
is stimulated to do great deeds.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Take the schoolboy, for instance.</p>

<p>In most of the great public schools of England,
the refractory schoolboy is still chastised
by means of the rod, but do not imagine that<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 192]</span>
punishment is administered in an arbitrary
fashion. The young offender is brought to
judgment. The head master hears the evidence
against him, and listens to his defense.
If he is found guilty of the offense with which
he is charged, the head master pronounces his
condemnation and the boy is corrected on the
spot. He submits without a murmur. The
system may be bad, but what is good about it
is that it generally proves a thorough <i>correction</i>
for the child.</p>

<p>Under similar circumstances, a French
schoolboy would probably seize an inkstand,
or the first thing he could lay hands on, and
menace his judge or his executioner with it.</p>

<p>Do not ask me which of the two I prefer,
but let me tell you that the only punishments
I have any objection to are unjust or arbitrary
ones, and that severe ones, administered with
discretion, are generally salutary. At all
events, I ask you not to believe that the
young Englishman is cowardly because he
knows how to endure pain, and is submissive,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 193]</span>
for a few minutes later you will see him rejoin
his comrades at their play, and perform veritable
acts of heroism. It almost seems to me
that a child gives proof of courage in submitting
to a punishment which he knows he has
deserved, and that a spirit of submission to
discipline is more to be commended in him
than a spirit of rebellion. In resigning himself
to his fate, and enduring his punishment, the
English schoolboy learns to master a passion;
the French schoolboy, in rebelling, allows a
passion to master him. If the English system
is bad, the French one must be worse.</p>

<p>Since I have pronounced the word <i>rebellion</i>,
allow me to show you how differently the
thing is understood in French and English
schools.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that some privilege, which
the pupils have long enjoyed, and looked upon
as their right, has been withdrawn, rightly or
wrongly, no matter which. What will the
French schoolboys do? They will probably
retire to a dormitory, there to sulk and protest<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 194]</span>
<i>vi et armis</i>. They will barricade themselves,
victual the intrenchments for a few hours, and
prepare for a struggle. Rebellion has wonderful
charms for them; they are insurgents,
therefore they are heroes. If the cause be a
bad one, that matters little, it will be sanctified
by the revolution; the main thing is to
play at the <i>peuple souverain</i>. These hot-headed
youths will stand a siege as earnestly
as if they had to defend their native soil; dictionaries,
inkstands, boots, bedroom furniture,
such are the missiles that are pressed into service
in the glorious battle for liberty.</p>

<p>But, alas for youthful valor! it all fades
before the pleadings of an empty stomach;
the struggle is abandoned, the citadel forsaken,
and arms are laid down. The misguided
ones are received back into the fold, to
be submitted to stricter discipline than ever,
the heroic instigators of the little <i>f&ecirc;te</i> are, in
the end, restored to the tender care of their
mammas, or, in other words, expelled from the
school. And for a boy to be expelled from a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 195]</span>
French <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> is no light matter, for the doors
of all the others are closed to him, and the
pleasure of playing at heroes for a few hours is
often bought at the price of ruined prospects.</p>

<p>They manage these things differently in
England. Under the same circumstances, this
is what the schoolboys of old England would
do. A dozen of the most influential and
respectable among them would promptly form
themselves into a committee, and organize an
indignation meeting of all the pupils of the
school. This meeting would be presided over
by the captain of the school, or even by one of
the masters, and the grievance would be discussed,
not with any display of temper, but
with the calm dignity of the free citizen.
Propositions made by the boys, and duly seconded
in a parliamentary manner, would be
put to the vote, and the president would be
charged to transmit such resolutions to the
proper authorities. The meeting would then
break up in a perfectly orderly manner and
without a murmur, everyone going his way,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 196]</span>
like a good Republican who had just performed
a civic duty of the gravest importance.</p>

<p>Such a meeting as this has never been interdicted
by the authorities, for the very simple
reason that such a meeting never endangered
the good discipline of a school.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Has it indeed fallen to our lot, to us who
live under a Republic, to see a people living
under a Monarchy enjoying every form of liberty;
liberty of thought, liberty of speech,
liberty of the press, liberty to meet together,
in fact the right of grumbling in every form
imaginable; to see them able to get redress for
all their grievances, without having recourse to
violence?</p>

<p>Do you remember the great manifestations
in favor of the abolition of the House of
Lords?</p>

<p>The Lords had refused to sanction the Franchise
Bill&mdash;a bill which was to give electoral
rights to two millions of Englishmen, who had<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 197]</span>
been deprived of them up to that time. Two
hundred thousand persons meet and quietly-pass
through the great arteries of London.
Not a voice is lifted. The immense crowd
makes for Hyde Park and there divides itself
into twelve groups around twelve improvised
platforms. Speeches are made, resolutions
passed, and the meeting breaks up in an orderly
manner.</p>

<p>But, you will say, the police were there, of
course, to see that these people did not break
the law.</p>

<p>The police, indeed! Yes, most certainly
they were there; but it was to protect the
people's right of meeting, and not to hinder
them, or oppose them, in the exercise of their
privileges.</p>

<p>It was really a wonderful sight for a foreigner,
to see this crowd, bent upon overthrowing
the Constitution, preceded, flanked, and
followed, by mounted police, whose duty it
was to see that these subjects of Her Majesty
were allowed to protest unmolested! And<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 198]</span>
that which afforded me some amusement and
more instruction still, was the sight of the
Prince of Wales and some friends of his, installed
on a balcony at Whitehall,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and evidently
there to see the fun; to see at Pall Mall
windows the faces of lords, apparently much
amused in watching these people, who had
taken a holiday, and who, if they did not gain
their point, had the satisfaction of feeling that
they lived in a country where they could air
their grievances freely.</p>

<p>The House of Lords exists still, but its
members passed the Franchise Bill.</p>

<p>The Lords are wise persons.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Ah! how quickly our anniversary-keepers
would draw in their horns, if the Minister of
the Interior spoke to them somewhat in this<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 199]</span>
manner: "You wish to hold your demonstration,
my friends ... I beg your pardon, citizens;
why, certainly! Demonstrate away, to
your heart's content; there is nothing to hinder
you. You want to carry a red flag about
the streets? Carry it by all means&mdash;red, yellow,
blue, any color of the rainbow that you
like best. I will put as many policemen at
your disposition as you may require to protect
you in the free exercise of your rights."</p>

<p>How small the revolutionary would look if
he were talked to in this way! How mortified
he would be! But draw your sword, and he
is happy. He goes about crying:</p>

<p>"The people are being slaughtered!"</p>

<p>It is the very worst course that could be
adopted. The proper cure for the mania for
demonstrations is not the sword, but a little
cold water.</p>

<p>Try how many followers you will get for a
standard of revolt raised with the cry:</p>

<p>"The people are being syringed?"</p>

<p>Ah! where is the Government that will have<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 200]</span>
first the strength, and then the good sense, to
leave the people alone, instead of doing its
best to irritate them into adopting the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of
martyr? Monarchy or Republic, what matters
the name of this Government, so that it gives
us what we are in search of&mdash;our liberty.</p>

<p>The English newspapers love to fill their
columns with the sayings and doings of French
Anarchists, so as to try and prove to their
readers that France "is still navigating on a
volcano," although they know very well that
our revolutionary mountains are incapable of
bringing forth even a mouse, as the ridiculous
failure of the proposed Anarchist demonstration
at Victor Hugo's funeral proved. The
English know perfectly well that in the year
1867, thanks to the inopportune meddling of
the police, there was a riot, in Hyde Park,
which was likely to have proved very serious.
The English know all this; but the pot always
had a trick of calling the kettle black.</p>

<p>Our lower orders are a thousand times more
intelligent than the English ones; and when<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 201]</span>
the French police force cease to be the symbol,
the instrument, of an arbitrary power, in order
to become, in some sort, the protection of the
people, our workmen will astonish the world
with their good behavior, as they did on the
day of our immortal poet's apotheosis.</p>

<p>The Frenchman is impressionable, excitable;
but he is gentle, and easy to govern. The
Parisians never raised any riots that could not
be traced to the want of tact, or the malice,
of the Government; and we all know that if
M. Thiers had not been so bent upon putting
down a small revolution, he would not have
stirred up a large one; the Commune would
have been nipped in the bud at the Buttes-Chaumont
on the 18th of May, 1871. The
harmless folk who were looking after the
famous cannons would have been only too
pleased to go home.</p>

<p>A nation does not learn the proper use of
freedom in a day. It does not understand at
first sight that obedience and respect for the
law are two virtues indispensable to everyone<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 202]</span>
who wishes to get on tolerably under a democracy;
it is for the Government to teach it its
lesson. To do this properly, an authority is
wanted which shall be vigilant, while making
itself felt as little as possible.</p>

<p>This liberty should be the monopoly of no
one, but the privilege of each and all. Every
time our police officers pounce upon a red flag
and tear it up, every time they suppress a
Catholic school, or force open the doors of a
convent, the fruits of many a month's lessons
are lost. We go back; but the cause of the
white or red flag is advanced.</p>

<p>Why is Roman Catholicism perfectly powerless
in England, politically speaking?</p>

<p>Because Protestant England allows the
Romanists to open as many churches, schools,
and convents as they please.</p>

<p>All that England demands from those who
live on her hospitable soil is respect for her
laws. Monarchs exiled by their subjects, and
Communists, Nihilists, Socialists, exiled by
their monarchs, may jostle one another in her<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 203]</span>
streets any day; the individual liberty of the
revolutionary subject being held as sacred as
that of the ex-monarch.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Our neighbor's eccentricities are but the
natural fruit of liberty; and these same eccentricities,
which amuse us so much, in England
pass unnoticed. Everyone does as he pleases,
and thinks it quite natural that others should
do the same. I have seen young girls on tricycles
make their way through a crowd, without
an unpleasant remark or a joke being
indulged in at their expense. The men made
way, and allowed them to pass without remarking
them more than if they had been on
horseback.</p>

<p>Do not fear the abuse of liberty; among an
intelligent race, good sense will always take
the upper hand.</p>

<p>Liberty is sure to lead to a few excesses;
but it does not suffer because of them.</p>

<p>Take England again.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>English religious liberty is in no wise in
danger because the law tolerates, nay, protects,
the rowdy proselytes of the Booth family.
True religion may suffer, but not religious
liberty.</p>

<p>The right of association is not in danger
because a <i>philanthropic</i> club has been formed
at Ashpull, in Lancashire, by men who subscribe
to defray the costs when one of their
number is fined for ill-treating his wife.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>No, no, these eccentricities do but prove the
vital force of England.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>There is no need to penetrate deeply into
French and English life, to study the tempers
of the two nations. The streets of London
and Paris furnish the observer with ample
materials every day.</p>

<p>In the month of April, 1891, I was one day
on the top of the Odeon omnibus. In the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 205]</span>
Boulevard des Italiens some repairs were going
on, and at the corner of the Rue de Richelieu
there was such a crowd of carriages as to cause
a block. The question then arose, who was to
pass first, those who came from the Madeleine
or those who came from the Bastille. An
altercation soon arose between the drivers, and
that in a vocabulary which I will spare my
readers. Meanwhile, the string of carriages
lengthened, and the matter was becoming serious.
At last up comes a police officer who
gets the situation explained to him, forthwith
enters into a discussion with the drivers,
and tries to make the Madeleine party understand
that it is their place to give way. He
might as well have talked to the pavement.
A hubbub uprose on all sides enough to make
one's hair stand on end. Everybody was in
the right, it seemed, and the poor police
officer, tired of seeing his parliamentary
efforts so fruitless, withdrew, saying: "Very
well, then, do as you please; I'll have nothing
more to do with it" (<i>sic</i>). About a quarter of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 206]</span>
an hour later, we turned into the Rue de
Richelieu.</p>

<p>And now here is a scene which you may
witness every day in any part of London.</p>

<p>In every spot where the traffic is great, you
will see a policeman. He is there to regulate
the circulation of the vehicles, and protect the
foot passengers who may wish to cross the
road. In the discharge of this duty, all that
he has to do is to lift his hand, and, at this
gesture, the drivers stop, like a company of
soldiers at the word "halt!" Not a murmur,
not a sign of impatience, not a word. When
the little accumulation of foot passengers has
safely crossed, the policeman lowers his hand,
and everything is in motion again.</p>

<p>How many times, as I have looked on at this
sight, which to the English appears so natural,
have I said enviously to myself: "If these
English people are free, if they are masters of
half the world, and of themselves into the bargain,
it is because they know how to obey!"</p>

<p>I know the favorite explanation of these<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 207]</span>
striking contrasts: the temperaments are different;
the blood does not circulate in English
veins with so much impetuosity as it does
in French ones. This is true, though only to
a certain extent. But be not deceived; it is
the difference which exists between the education
of the two races that is the real solution
of the problem.</p>

<h3>THE HUMORS OF POLITICS.</h3>


<p>Ah! what I envy the English is that security
for the morrow, which they owe to a form
of government no one, so to speak, thinks seriously
of questioning.</p>

<p>The Englishman is the stanchest monarchist,
and at the same time the freest man in the
world, which proves that freedom is compatible
with a monarchial government. There is
no French Legitimist more royalist than he,
there is no French Republican more passionately
fond of liberty; nay, I will go so far as
to say that, in France, people would be
treated as dangerous demagogues, who demanded
certain liberties which the English
have long possessed under a monarchy, and to
defend which the most conservative of them
would allow himself to be rent in pieces.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>At first sight, the theory of government in
England appears to be most simple; two great
political parties, each having its leader, whose
authority is uncontested, and who takes office
amid the acclamations of half the nation. Is
the country threatened with danger, party
spirit vanishes, Liberals and Conservatives disappear;
the <i>Englishman</i> is supreme.</p>

<p>All this appears as simple as admirable. I
will show farther on, however, that if there is
fixity in the form of the government, there
cannot be any consistency in the politics of the
country.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>Things are forgotten to such an extent in
England that I have rarely seen a Liberal
paper revert to the fact that Lord Beaconsfield,
the illustrious leader of the Conservative
party, began his political life in the ranks of
the Radicals, or Conservative papers remind
people that Mr. Gladstone, the leader of the
Liberals, began his brilliant career in the Con<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 211]</span>servative
ranks. At all events, I never saw
anyone reproach these great statesmen with
having turned their coats. Lord Derby, who
was Minister for Foreign Affairs under Lord
Beaconsfield, was Colonial Minister in Mr.
Gladstone's Cabinet. <i>Punch</i> had a caricature
on the subject, and there was an end of the
matter.</p>

<p>Such proceedings would excite contempt or
indignation in France; but to judge them in
England from a French point of view would
be absurd.</p>

<p>In France, political convictions rest on the
form of government. In England, everyone,
or almost everyone, is of one mind on that
subject; Conservatives and Liberals both will
have a democracy, having for its object the
material, moral, and intellectual progress of the
people, with a monarchy to act as ballast.</p>

<p>The only difference that I see in the history
of the two parties, during the last fifty years,
is that the Conservatives willingly sacrifice
their home policy to the prestige of a spirited<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 212]</span>
foreign policy, while the Liberals pay more
attention to internal politics, to the detriment,
perhaps, of foreign ones.</p>

<p>Here it should be added that, when an Englishman
accepts the task of forming a ministry,
it is, in the eyes of his partisans, out of
pure abnegation, to serve his country, and, in
the eyes of his opponents, out of pure ambition,
to serve his own interests.</p>

<p>The difference which separates a Monarchist
and a Republican in France is an abyss that
nothing can bridge over; the difference which
separates a Liberal and a Conservative in
England is but a trifling step.</p>

<p>So the candidate for Parliament, who rehearses,
<i>in petto</i>, the little speech that he means
to address to the electors, winds up with: "Gentlemen,
such are my political convictions, but,
if they do not please you, let it be well understood
between us that I am ready to change
them." Or: "Gentlemen, I used to be a Conservative,
and at bottom I am a Conservative
still, but Mr. Gladstone has appointed me a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 213]</span>
Civil Commissioner at a salary of &pound;2000 a
year, and I consider that a statesman who
chooses his servants so well ought to be supported
by all sensible men. Besides, in my
new capacity, it is not a party that I am serving,
it is my country."</p>

<p>To speak seriously, I really see very little
either in the so-called Liberal or Conservative
principles that can cause an Englishman to be
anything more than the partisan of a certain
group of men.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, it is not surprising
that English politics should, above all things,
consist in doing in Office what has been valiantly
fought in Opposition; it is a school of
incisive, passionate debate&mdash;nothing more.
The following incident, which is as instructive
as it is amusing, is sufficient proof of this:</p>

<p>When Lord Beaconsfield deftly snatched
Cyprus from the "unspeakable" Turk, in 1878,
and, presenting it to John Bull, asked him to
admire the fine catch, John's Liberal sons
turned up their noses, declared that the hon<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 214]</span>esty
of the proceeding was dubious, and vowed
the place was not fit to send British soldiers
to. "It would hardly be humane to send our
convicts there," they said; "not even flies
could stand the climate." Two years later the
Tories went out of office, and the Liberals
came to power. What happened? You
think, perhaps, that the Liberals promptly
restored the island to the Turks with their
compliments and apologies. Catch them!
Better than that. No sooner were the Tories
out of office than the yachts of three leading
Liberals might have been seen sailing toward
Cyprus, which, it would seem, a simple change
of ministry had changed into a health resort.
In the beginning of May of the current year,
the Liberal Government gave orders to the
military authorities of the army of occupation
in Egypt, to send to Cyprus all the sick soldiers,
who were in a fit state to be transferred&mdash;not
to finish them up, but actually to hasten
their convalescence.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>Ever since every householder has enjoyed
electoral rights, each general election has
placed the Opposition in power; and the enfranchisement
of Mr. Gladstone's new <i>couches
sociales</i> is not likely to change this state of
things, which is, indeed, very easy to account
for.</p>

<p>The necessarily guarded speech of those in
office does not catch the ear of the ignorant
multitude so readily as the irresponsible talk
of the Opposition. The man in power has to
defend a policy, the other attacks it right and
left; it is he who has the popular <i>r&ocirc;le</i>. "Ah!"
say the crowd, "smart fellow that! if we could
only have him in Office, things would be done
in a proper manner! What has become of all
the fine promises of the ministry?"</p>

<p>So they make up their minds to vote for the
man who comes to them with fresh promises,
and to throw overboard the one who has not
been able to keep his.</p>

<p>If the Government has engaged in war, the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 216]</span>
Opposition proves to the people what a disastrous,
or, at the best, what a useless war it
was; if the Government has been able to maintain
peace, the Opposition proves to the people
that it was at the price of national honor.
The Opposition is always in the right.</p>

<p>To think that men of talent should lower
themselves so far as to flatter the populace
with such platitudes to obtain their favor!
How sad a sight is this vulgarization of politics!
And people often wonder how it is that,
in democracies, the great thinkers, the genius
of the nation, refrain from buying the favors
of the people at the price of their dignity!
Unhappily, this is the fate of democracies;
they can but seldom be ruled by the genius
of the nation, by men who would not be appreciated
by the masses. No system lends
itself better to the reign of unscrupulous mediocrity,
for no other system obliges its chiefs to
come and humble themselves before the ignorant
populace, by giving them acrobatic performances
in order to obtain their suffrages.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>Under a democracy, everybody goes into
politics, and everybody requires to be pleased.</p>

<p>The literary man, the scholar, the artist, all
are criticised by more or less competent
judges; but the statesman, who is there that
does not criticise him? Who does not take
upon himself to judge him without appeal?
Who does not drag him in the mud? Who
does not cry, "Stop thief!" when he is bold
enough to buy a dozen railway shares, like the
smallest shopkeeper in the land?</p>

<p>No one says to himself, "The Prime Minister
is not a fool; he ought to know what he is
about; and even if he were a rogue, is it not
to his interest to serve his country to the best
of his ability?"</p>

<p>Why, even the schoolboy goes into politics
nowadays.</p>

<p>I warrant that there is not a single man, in
France or England, who does not believe himself
perfectly capable of criticising the acts of
his Prime Minister, and very few, who do not
feel equal to filling his place, if, for <i>the good of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 218]</span>
their country</i>, they were called by their fellow-citizens
to fulfill these arduous duties.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>There is a great virtue, a virtue eminently
English, which we French do not possess;
respect for the man who is down. Yet it is
not that we lack magnanimity; but we also
have our contrasts. Generous, of a chivalric
character, with a repugnance for any kind of
meanness, we yet insult the fallen man and
even bespatter the memory of one who has
gone to the grave. We consoled ourselves for
Sedan by singing "<i>C'est le Sire de Fiche-ton-Camp</i>."
On the death of M. Thiers, a celebrated
Bonapartist journalist exclaimed that
he could jump for joy over the tomb of him
who had just liberated his country. Open the
newspapers of to-day, and you will still see
Gambetta's memory insulted.</p>

<p>In England, they would have forgotten that
Gambetta was a party man, and have remembered
only his eloquence, which that of Mira<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 219]</span>beau
alone could have eclipsed, and which
made him one of the brightest ornaments of
contemporary France.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>When Mr. Bright left the political arena for
a world from whence jealousy is banished, and
subscription lists were opened for erecting a
statue to him, the Conservatives sent their
contributions as well as the Liberals; they forgot
the Radical, and remembered but the orator
and the philanthropist. At the death of
Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield, it was
Mr. Gladstone, the political enemy of the Tory
chief, who pronounced the panegyric of that
illustrious man in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>This is a sentiment that is found, it is interesting
to notice, in all classes, even down to
the English rough. When two men of the
lower classes fight, and one of them falls to the
ground, the other waits until his adversary is
up again, before returning to the attack. Do
not imagine, however, that this sentiment is<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 220]</span>
born of magnanimous bravery, for this same
man, who respects his fallen adversary, will, as
soon as he reaches his hovel, seize his wife by
her hair, knock her down, and literally kick her
to death at the first provocation.</p>

<p>In the latter case, there is no combat; there
is correction administered by the master to his
slave.</p>

<p>If the English have more respect than we
for the man who is down, it is because they
forget much more quickly than ourselves.
Does this prove that they have less intelligence
or more generosity? No. They are
less impressionable, that is all. The trace disappears
more easily, because the impression is
less deep. I think this is one of the most
remarkable differences between the two peoples.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>In France, it is not an unwise act that ruins
a political man&mdash;it is, above all things, a phrase
blurted out in a moment of exultation. An
act is forgotten sooner or later; but an unfor<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 221]</span>tunate
phrase sticks to a man, and becomes
part and parcel of him, his motto, written on
his forehead in indelible characters, and which
he carries with him to the grave.</p>

<p>Take the case of M. Emile Ollivier. Since
the fall of Thiers, we have had no minister,
with the exception of Gambetta, whose political
talent could be compared to that of the
Liberal minister of Napoleon III. And yet,
M. Emile Ollivier little knows his compatriots,
if he thinks it is possible for him ever again to
enter the political arena. To this very day,
the masses ignore that it was he who proclaimed
war with Prussia, but there is scarcely
a child who does not know that he said "he
contemplated the coming struggle with a light
heart." M. Ollivier is, and will remain to the
day of his death, the <i>light-hearted man</i>. Ridicule
kills in France, and M. Ollivier is ridiculous.
It is all over with him.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 222]</span>M. Jules
Favre was a great orator, and for
that reason one of the ornaments of his century.
This is forgotten. He signed the disastrous
conditions of peace dictated by Prince
Bismarck. That might have been overlooked.
But he had said beforehand that "not one inch
of territory, not one stone of any French fortress,
would he yield." This sentence was his
political knell.</p>

<p>General Ducrot was a brave soldier. On
leaving Paris to go and attack the Prussians,
he was so ill-advised as to declare that he
would return "dead or victorious." However,
he was still more ill-advised to come back alive
and vanquished. Here was another only fit to
throw overboard.</p>

<p>Our history is full of similar incidents;
actions pass away and are forgotten, words
remain. Ask any ordinary Frenchman, not
well up in the history of France, who Mirabeau
was. He will tell you that Mirabeau was a
representative of the people, who one day exclaimed
at the <i>Assembl&eacute;e Constituante</i>: "We<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 223]</span>
are here by the power of the people; nothing
but the power of the bayonet shall remove us."</p>

<p>The history of France might be written
between inverted commas.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. has gone down to posterity
with the formula: "<i>L'Etat c'est moi</i>"; and
Napoleon III. with that device, suggested by
the irony of fate: "<i>L'Empire c'est la paix</i>."
Lamartine is the man who, outside the H&ocirc;tel
de Ville, cried: "The tricolor flag has been
round the world; the red flag has only been
round the Champ de Mars." Thiers said:
"The Republican form of government is the
one that divides us the least." Gambetta:
"Clericalism; that is the enemy."</p>

<p>And to parody a celebrated proverb, I might
say that French politics may be summed up in
the words:</p>

<p><i>Acta volant, verba manent.</i></p>

<h3>LORDS AND SENATORS.</h3>


<p>The existence of a hereditary House of Lords
is a standing insult to the common sense of
the English people.</p>

<p>England is governed by the eldest sons of
the aristocracy.</p>

<p>Now, all who have had much to do with
youth are perfectly agreed that, as a rule, the
eldest son is the least intelligent in each
family.</p>

<p>The first born is a <i>ballon d'essai</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover, the eldest son of the aristocrat is
the sole heir to his father's title and estates.
He knows that the fortune cannot escape him.
And so, at school, he does no work; he
leaves that sort of thing to his younger brothers,
who will have to make their way in the
world. When he leaves school or college, his<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 226]</span>
chief subjects of preoccupation are Jews and
jockeys.</p>

<p>It is needless to add that, in the House of
Lords, the proportion of Conservatives to Liberals
is overwhelming.</p>

<p>Consequently, when the Liberals are in
power, the House of Lords is a dangerous
institution, which may at every moment hinder
the working of the governmental machine;
and when the Conservatives are in power, the
House of Lords is a useless institution, because
its approbation can be relied upon in
advance by the Government.</p>

<p>Does it not seem as if any second chamber
must necessarily be dangerous or useless?</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>There is an episode of French history which,
to my mind, has been forgotten much too
soon.</p>

<p>It teaches a great lesson on the usefulness of
Upper Houses.</p>

<p>It was under the Second Empire.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>The French Senate was then, intellectually
speaking, a body of men superior to the House
of Lords, since they were picked men&mdash;chosen
by the Emperor, it is true, but still chosen.
With the exception of Sainte-Beuve, these
senators of the Empire were more or less
Bonapartists; cardinals, archbishops, marshals,
generals, literary men, all men of importance.
The duty of the Senate was to watch over the
Constitution, and to stop any bill, passed by
the Chamber of Deputies, that might have
endangered the existence of the actual form of
Government.</p>

<p>Well, in July, 1870, the Franco-Prussian war
broke out, and, on the 4th of September, in
the same year, the Chamber of Deputies deposed
the Emperor, and proclaimed the Republic.</p>

<p>Here was a grand opportunity for the senators
of showing their power, and of earning
the 30,000 francs that they each received from
their master.</p>

<p>Yet what happened?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>Not one voice was raised by the Senate
against the act of the deputies.</p>

<p>Better still: nobody thought of taking the
trouble to dismiss them officially. In presence
of the strong will of the people, they packed
up their traps quietly, and, to the best of my
recollection, even forgot to go to the counting-house
to receive their month's pay.</p>

<p>Poor senators! they seemed to have the
measure of their power in stormy times to an
inch.</p>

<p>In presence of the will of the nation,
strongly manifested, the House of Lords
would be as powerless as the French Senate
was in 1870.</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>A strange application of that great English
principle, "the right man in the right place," is
the existence of this same Upper House in
England!</p>

<p class="center">&#8258;</p>

<p>What! can it be that this, the most sensible
nation of the world, who has withdrawn all the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 229]</span>
privileges of its monarchs, who has imposed
restrictions upon them, and will not even allow
them to make the slightest political allusion in
public, can it be this nation that has given
itself so many masters at once? If the English
do not allow their kings unlimited power,
it is because, in their wisdom, they fear that
those kings may be born fools, or grow into
despots; but out of five hundred lords, three
or four hundred may be born fools; where
then is the gain? Better be governed by one
fool than by three or four hundred.</p>

<p>Among a free people, intellect alone ought
to be admitted into the councils of the nation.</p>

<p>No one could have a word to say against
such men as the Duke of Argyll and the Marquis
of Salisbury having a vote to cast into
the scales of England's destinies; but would
not these able members of the aristocracy of
birth gain in influence and prestige, if they sat
in an elected house, side by side with the aristocracy
of talent?</p>

<p>Perhaps they may think so themselves.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>The House of Lords owes its existence to
the English taste for antiquities or curiosities;
this people, to its honor be it said, only slowly
rids itself of its trammels.</p>

<p>It may safely be predicted that the first
great political gust of wind will blow away to
pieces this sort of hydropathic establishment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>WHAT FRANCE HAS DONE TO MERIT THE
RESPECT OF THE WORLD.</h3>


<p>France, ruined by the wars and extravagances
of Louis XIV., exasperated by the turpitudes
of Louis XV., encouraged by the weakness of
Louis XVI., revolts. Thrones tremble, and
the whole world is awe-struck at the terrible
Revolution. Kings league themselves together
against her; but such is her might that,
with soldiers half armed, half clothed, half fed,
she puts to flight the allied armies of the enemies,
who had sworn to crush her.</p>

<p>Up rises a man and wrests from her all the
liberty she had just bought at the price of so
much bloodshed. To steady himself upon an
unsteady throne, Napoleon engages in dynastic
wars for ten years, marching his victorious
army from capital to capital, while Europe<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 232]</span>
wonders and trembles. At length the eagle
falls, and France, sick of military glory, beaten,
but not humiliated, takes breath and submits
to the Restoration imposed upon her by the
allied invaders. To console herself for the loss
of the Republic, a form of government least
calculated to foster literature and the fine arts,
she profits by the return of monarchical rule to
inaugurate the Golden Age of 1830. I say <i>the
Age of 1830</i>, for such is the name this epoch,
one of the most glorious in the history of
France, will be known by in the next century.
Now appear, in poetry, Victor Hugo, Lamartine,
Alfred de Musset, B&eacute;ranger; in fiction,
Balzac, Chateaubriand, Alexandre Dumas,
George Sand; in history, Thiers, Guizot; in
political oratory, Manuel, Foy, Berryer; in
criticism, Sainte-Beuve, Jules Janin; in painting,
Horace Vernet, Ingres, Delacroix, Gudin;
in music, Boi&euml;ldieu, Herold, Hal&eacute;vy, Auber;
in tragedy, Talma, Rachel; in comedy, Mars,
Duvernoy; in opera, Nourrit, Duprez, Lablache,
Baroilhet, Malibran.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>I have mentioned but a few of the princes
of talent.</p>

<p>To keep her hand in practice, she makes the
conquest of Algeria, and, later on, having
nothing else particular in hand, she takes it
into her head to make the Suez Canal, a gigantic
undertaking, which of itself would be
enough to save the nineteenth century from
oblivion. Ever enamored of great names,
she re-establishes the Empire, because there is
a man in the world who bears the name of the
victor of Austerlitz. Smitten once more with
that strange malady, the love of glory, she
fights Russia in 1855 to prevent her from
going to Constantinople, and Austria in 1859
to create Italian unity. Then comes that terrible
year, the year 1870. With an army of
350,000 men, she sanctions a war, like the child
that she is, with a nation, which for sixteen
years had been silently preparing to avenge
her defeat at Jena, and which had 1,200,0000
men ready to take the field. She is conquered,
and, alas! humiliated. She pays her<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 234]</span>
conquerors $1,000,000,000, but this she has
almost forgotten, and sees wrenched from her
two provinces that she loved and was beloved
by; this she will never forget. The following
year, she holds up her head, the richest and
most esteemed of European nations. To-day,
if she only had a leader, republican or
monarch, she would be the strongest.</p>

<p>Ah, dear Foreigners all over the world, respect
her, that beautiful France! I have often
heard the sincerest and most intelligent of you
say that no country in the world would probably
have been able to do as much.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In this new and <i>taking</i> volume, Mr. Landon recounts his thirty
years' experience as a humorous writer and lecturer. "Eli Perkins"
needs no introduction. His name and fame are familiar to everybody&mdash;&mdash;who
laughs. Reminiscences of such an exceptional career
promise an intellectual treat&mdash;and the book amply fulfills the promise.
In fact it does more; for Mr. Landon has not only put into it his
own good stories, but he quotes, with charming skill, scores of others
that he has heard told by the well-known men whom he has met in
the course of his professional life. Thus, in his acknowledgment,
Mr. Landon says that he has listened to thousands of anecdotes,
reminiscences, and funny experiences from the lips of the following
witty, wise, and eloquent thinkers, now dead: Abraham Lincoln,
Charles Sumner, Generals Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Admiral Farragut,
Beecher, Roscoe Conkling, Garfield, Wendell Phillips, W. R.
Travers, Artemus Ward, Nasby, Josh Billings, John G. Saxe, and
others. Among the living, Chauncey M. Depew, General Butler,
Horace Porter, G. W. Curtis, Jay Gould, Eugene Field, Mark

<p>There is no more pleasantly familiar name in this country than that of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Depew</span>, and it is by his speeches that he is best known. Very few of these have
ever been printed in their entirety, and many of them have only been dealt out in
fragments by the daily papers, and yet he has won a world-wide reputation by
them. Taken in their complete form, as they are given in this volume, they are
models of what such speeches should be. Nothing could seem dryer than some of
the subjects of Mr. <span class="smcap">Depew's</span> speeches, but there is not a dry line in any one of
them. They bristle with thought and sparkle with wit. As a story-teller he has
few equals, and he has the art of telling an old story so that it strikes the hearer
with all the freshness of a brand-new one, while of new stories he seems to have an
inexhaustible supply.</p>
